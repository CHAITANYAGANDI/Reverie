/**
 * The lock on the second door.
 *
 * <h2>What was open</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code /ws/**} is {@code permitAll} in {@code SecurityConfig}, because the
 * SockJS handshake is a plain HTTP GET that carries no credential — a browser
 * cannot set headers on it. That is normal and fine. What was missing is the
 * check that has to happen afterwards: nothing authenticated the STOMP
 * {@code CONNECT} frame, and nothing checked who was subscribing to what. Any
 * client that could reach the port could subscribe to
 * {@code /topic/meetings/{id}} for any id and watch somebody else's meeting
 * being processed.
 *
 * <p>The blast radius was narrow — ids are opaque, the frames carry
 * {@code {status, progress, message}} and no transcript, and the notification
 * frame deliberately carries an unread <em>count</em> and nothing else (see
 * {@code NotificationPublisher}) — but "narrow" is not a security model, and it
 * only held because there was one account. With real users it is somebody
 * else's data.
 *
 * <h2>Two checks, not one</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>CONNECT</b> establishes who this connection is, from the same token the
 * API uses, verified by the same {@link ClerkTokens}. No identity, no
 * connection: the frame is refused rather than allowed through as anonymous,
 * because an anonymous connection that can subscribe to nothing is a socket
 * held open for no reason and a subscription bug waiting to matter.
 *
 * <p><b>SUBSCRIBE</b> authorises the destination against that identity, and it
 * is <b>default deny</b>. Two shapes are allowed and everything else is
 * refused, so a topic added later is private until somebody writes it down
 * here. Getting that the other way round is a mistake you make once and never
 * notice.
 *
 * <h2>Why the broker cannot do this for us</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code enableSimpleBroker("/topic")} fans out to every subscriber of a
 * destination. Spring's {@code /user/**} destinations would scope by principal
 * for free, but the topics are public by name and the publishers address them
 * by meeting id — so the check has to happen where a subscription is accepted,
 * which is here.
