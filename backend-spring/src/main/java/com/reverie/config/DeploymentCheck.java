/**
 * Refuses to start a production deployment that is still wearing development
 * settings.
 *
 * <h2>Why a startup check and not a default</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every value below has a development default that is correct on a laptop
 * and wrong on the internet: an auth mode that trusts a header, a shared secret
 * printed in this repository, a CORS origin of {@code http://localhost:3000}.
 * Tightening the defaults themselves is not available — the local stack is the
 * reason they exist, and breaking it to protect a deployment that has not
 * happened yet trades a real cost for a hypothetical one.
 *
 * <p>What makes them dangerous is not their value but their silence. Each one
 * fails in a way that looks like success: the app starts, the health check
 * passes, pages render. {@code REVERIE_AUTH_MODE} unset serves every request
 * as whoever asks. {@code APP_FRONTEND_URL} unset blocks every browser request
 * at CORS, which reads as "the API is down". Nothing announces itself, so the
 * announcement has to be built.
 *
 * <p>So the mode declares itself instead. Under the {@code production} profile
 * — set by {@code render.yaml} and by nothing else — a development-shaped value
 * is a startup failure with a named cause, before the first request is served.
 * A deployment that cannot boot is a bad ten minutes; a deployment that boots
 * open is a bad quarter.
 *
 * <h2>Why all of them at once</h2>
 *
 * <p>The problems are collected and reported together rather than thrown one at
 * a time. Fixing a misconfigured deploy one restart per variable, each cycle
 * revealing the next thing wrong, is how a checklist becomes an afternoon.

     * Production must be able to send the three messages nobody can opt out of.
     *
     * <h2>Why this is a refusal and not a warning</h2>
     *
     * <p>Five of the seven messages are switchable and off by default, so a
     * deployment with no provider simply never queues them. Two are not, and one
     * of those is the only record of an irreversible act:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>the account closed and its data deleted</b> — sent after the user
     *       row, the address and the counts are gone, so there is nothing left
     *       anywhere to rebuild it from and no bell to fall back to;</li>
     *   <li><b>the transcription allowance is spent</b> — the message that stops
     *       "you're out" being read as "your account is closed";</li>
     *   <li><b>retention deleted something</b> — for accounts that asked, the
     *       only notice that data went, from a job that runs unattended.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Unconfigured, the outbox does exactly what it was designed to do: it
     * keeps the rows, because a queue that expired its own contents during an
     * outage would be the at-most-once behaviour this whole design replaced. The
     * consequence is that a production deployment that never sets a key
     * accumulates account-closure notices for months and then, the day somebody
     * finally configures Resend, delivers all of them at once. That is a worse
     * outcome than either sending or not sending, and it is invisible until it
     * happens — which is the same shape as every other check in this class.
     *
     * <h2>Two valid modes</h2>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Real mail.</b> {@code REVERIE_MAIL_SELF_ONLY=false}, a key, and a
     *       sender on a domain somebody owns. This is what a product is.</li>
     *   <li><b>Self-only.</b> {@code REVERIE_MAIL_SELF_ONLY=true} with
     *       {@code REVERIE_MAIL_SELF_USER_ID} naming the single allowed account.
     *       A shared or absent sender is then acceptable, because the operator
     *       is the only account holder — and {@link SelfOnlyAccess} makes that
     *       true rather than assumed.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Anything else is a refusal, including self-only with no allowed
     * account: that is the shape where a stranger can sign up into a deployment
     * whose entire justification for a shared sender was that no stranger can.
     *
     * <h2>Development is untouched</h2>
     *
     * <p>This whole class is {@code @Profile("production")}. A laptop runs with
     * no key, queues nothing it cannot deliver — the five switchable messages
     * are off — and the relay claims nothing at all while
     * {@link com.reverie.service.Mailer#enabled()} is false.
     *
     * <h2>What is deliberately not in the message</h2>
     *
     * <p>The key. Not its value, not its length, not a prefix, not a masked
     * form. These problems are thrown as an exception message and logged at
     * startup, which is exactly the sort of place a credential ends up shipped
     * to a log aggregator and kept for a year. The only fact worth reporting is
     * whether it is set, and this reports that.

     * <h2>What makes this acceptable when the same configuration is refused
     * otherwise</h2>
     *
     * <p>Resend's shared sender delivers only to the Resend account owner. In a
     * product that is a misdirected account-closure notice. In a deployment with
     * exactly one account, and where that is <em>enforced</em> rather than
     * hoped, the operator <b>is</b> the account holder — so a message that
     * reaches only them is correct.
     *
     * <p>Which is why the id is required rather than encouraged. Without it the
     * claim is an intention, {@link SelfOnlyAccess} enforces nothing, and a
     * stranger can sign up into a deployment whose whole justification for
     * accepting a shared sender was that no stranger can. That is a worse
     * position than either honest alternative, so it is a refusal.
     *
     * <p>Missing mail credentials are <em>not</em> a refusal here. A private
     * deployment that never sends anything is a coherent thing to run; it is
     * warned about, loudly, on every boot.
     *
     * <p><b>Not the only thing that catches a missing id.</b>
     * {@link SelfOnlyAccess} refuses to construct in that state, so startup
     * fails in every profile rather than only in production, and whichever of
     * the two fires first the deployment does not come up. This branch stays
     * because it is the one that reports the problem <em>alongside every other
     * problem</em> — fixing a misconfigured deploy one restart per variable is

     * The runtime must not reach Postgres through a transaction-mode pooler.
     *
     * <h2>What goes wrong</h2>
     *
     * <p>Row-level security is armed per connection: {@link TenantAwareDataSource}
     * runs {@code set_config('app.user_id', ?, false)} as each pooled connection
     * is handed out, and every policy in V9 tests what that set. The {@code
     * false} makes it <em>session</em>-level, which is correct for a connection
     * that belongs to this process — and wrong through a pooler that does not
     * keep sessions.
     *
     * <p>A transaction-mode pooler assigns a server connection per
     * <em>transaction</em>. The {@code set_config} lands on whichever backend
     * served it; the query that follows is a different transaction and may be
     * given a different backend, where {@code app.user_id} was never set. RLS
     * then matches nothing, and — this is the part that cost four days — that
     * is not an error. It is a 200 with an empty list and a perfectly ordinary
     * 404:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code GET /meetings} answers "you have no conversations",</li>
     *   <li>{@code GET /projects} answers "you have no folders",</li>
     *   <li>{@code GET /meetings/{id}} and {@code /transcript} answer 404,</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>each of them intermittently, per request, to an account that is
     * perfectly intact — because whether a given request works depends on which
     * backend the pooler happened to give it. Reloading re-rolls it, which is
     * why reloading "fixes" it.
     *
     * <p>And the same mechanism runs the other way: a backend still carrying a
     * previous borrower's {@code app.user_id} answers <em>this</em> request with
     * <em>that</em> tenant's rows. Nothing in the application can detect either
     * case, because from here both are the database answering honestly.
     *
     * <h2>Why refusing to start</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because the failure is silent and looks like data loss to the person
     * using it. The direct endpoint is the same host with {@code -pooler}
     * removed, and Hikari is already the connection pool this process needs.
