/**
 * Warns an account before its retention policy deletes something.
 *
 * <h2>The only message here that prevents a loss</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every other thing Reverie sends reports something that has already
 * happened. This one arrives while there is still something to do about it, and
 * that is the whole justification for it interrupting anybody: a retention
 * policy is chosen once, in a settings page, and then fires unattended months
 * later — precisely when whoever chose it has stopped thinking about it. The
 * app cannot tell them, because they are not going to open the app.
 *
 * <h2>One warning per deletion date, not one per week</h2>
 *
 * <p>This is the correction the audit asked for. The rule used to be "at most
 * one warning every seven days", deduplicated by the day the warning was
 * <em>sent</em>. That fails in the exact case the message exists for:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Mon  meetings A and B are due on the 20th   -> warned
 *   Tue  meeting C crosses the horizon, due 21st -> suppressed, six days to go
 *   ...
 *   21st C is deleted. Nobody was ever told.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>So the unit is the <b>batch</b>, meaning everything the policy will delete
 * on one particular day, and the message is keyed to that day —
 * {@code retention-warning:{user}:{date}}. Two batches a day apart get two
 * warnings. The same batch gets one however many times this runs, because the
 * key is unique in {@code mail_outbox} and enqueueing is
 * {@code ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING}.
 *
 * <h2>Why it scans a window rather than a single day</h2>
 *
 * <p>Looking only at {@code today + 7} would be enough if this job never missed
 * a morning. It will miss mornings — a deploy, an outage, a scheduler that was
 * off. Scanning the whole week means a missed day is caught up the next time it
 * runs, and the key is what makes catching up safe: a batch already warned about
 * is a row that already exists.
 *
 * <p>Two in the morning UTC, an hour before the pass that does the deleting.
 * They look at different days so the order does not matter, but a job that warns
 * about deletions has no business running after them.
