/**
 * The morning digest of what is due, and what is already late.
 *
 * <h2>Why this one is worth an email when the recap was not</h2>
 *
 * <p>A deadline is the only thing Reverie extracts that carries a clock. A
 * summary is a record — it is as useful next week as it is this morning, and it
 * is sitting in the app either way. A commitment somebody made out loud in a
 * meeting is different: it has a day attached, and the reader is not in
 * Reverie on that day, they are in their calendar and their inbox. Of
 * everything V56 removed, this is the one that was doing work the app could not
 * do for itself.
 *
 * <h2>Eight in the morning, UTC</h2>
 *
 * <p>The slot the old digest had, which the retention pass was deliberately
 * timed away from and which has been empty since V56.
 *
 * <h2>Two queries, not one per account</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code dueByUser} is a grouped count over the whole table and answers
 * "who has anything at all" in a single round trip. Only those accounts are
 * then asked for their actual list. The alternative — {@code findDueThrough}
 * once per user — is a query per account per morning to discover that almost
 * none of them have anything, which is the cost that makes a digest job the
 * first thing to fall over as a product grows.
 *
 * <p>Both queries survived V56 unused. They were written for exactly this.
 *
 * <h2>Two instances, one digest</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here elects a leader and nothing needs to. Two instances waking at
 * 08:00:00 both build the same list and both enqueue with the same key --
 * {@code task-reminder:{user}:{date}} -- and the unique index turns the second
 * into a no-op rather than a second message. The same property covers a single
 * instance restarted at 08:00:01 by a deploy.
