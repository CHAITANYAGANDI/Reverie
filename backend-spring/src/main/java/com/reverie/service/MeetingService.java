     *       that were spoken; once the text says something else they point at
     *       the wrong ones, and a highlight that lands on the wrong word is
     *       worse than one estimated from the segment span — which is what the
     *       UI falls back to.
     *   <li>The meeting is re-indexed, because retrieval reads chunks rather
     *       than segments. Skipping it means the user corrects a name and chat
     *       carries on using the old one.

     * comes back as a second speaker. The transcript then reads as though the

     * two colours, two talk-time rows, two names to type.
     *
     * <p><b>Why renaming cannot do this.</b> {@code renameSpeakers} changes what
     * a speaker is called. Renaming both labels to "Priya" produces two
     * canonical speakers wearing one name, which is worse than the state it was
     * meant to fix: the turns stay separate, talk time still double-counts, and
     * `app.naming` refuses a name claimed by two speakers, so automatic naming
     * stops working on that person entirely. Ownership is what has to move.
     *
     * <p><b>What moves.</b> Every turn owned by {@code fromSpeakerKey} takes the
     * other speaker's key, display name and word-level attribution — the same
     * mutation {@link #moveWholeSegment} performs for a single turn, applied to
     * all of them. {@code speaker_raw} is deliberately left alone on every one:
     * it records what the provider said, a merge is Reverie's decision rather
     * than a correction to that record, and keeping it is what makes a mistaken
     * merge visible afterwards.
     *
     * <p><b>It does not learn anything.</b> There is no cross-meeting speaker
     * identity in Reverie and this does not reintroduce one — a merge is a
     * statement about two labels in one transcript and reaches nothing else.
     *
     * <p>Like a rename and a per-turn correction, this re-indexes and marks the
     * summary stale: retrieval passages carry the speaker prefix, and the
