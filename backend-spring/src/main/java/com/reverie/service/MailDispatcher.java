/**
 * Takes a batch of queued messages and tries to deliver them.
 *
 * <h2>Where the transaction boundary is, and why it is here</h2>
 *
 * <p>Split from {@link MailRelay} for the same reason {@code OutboxPublisher} is
 * split from {@code OutboxRelay}: the claim's locks last exactly as long as the
 * transaction, so claiming and marking have to happen inside one, and the
 * system tenant context has to be established outside it — the connection is
 * stamped when the transaction borrows it. A bean that both schedules itself
 * and opens its own transaction gets one of those two wrong quietly.
 *
 * <h2>At-least-once, and where the "once" actually comes from</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is an unavoidable gap: the provider can accept a message and this
 * process can die before it writes {@code sent_at}. No amount of care on this
 * side closes that — the two writes are in different systems. What closes it is
 * the dedupe key travelling to Resend as an idempotency key, so the retry is
 * recognised there as the same message and not delivered again. This class is
 * therefore deliberately at-least-once, and says so.
 *
 * <h2>The de-duplication is not open-ended, and this is where that is enforced</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Resend keeps an idempotency key for 24 hours.</b> After that the same
 * key on the same message is a new request and will be delivered again. So the
 * guarantee above is not "exactly once, eventually" — it is "exactly once
 * within the provider's window", and the retry schedule has to fit inside that
 * window or the guarantee is a claim rather than a property.
 *
 * <p>It does, with room. {@link #worstCaseRetrySpan()} computes the span from
 * the same constants the retries actually use, and
 * {@code MailRetryWindowTest} asserts it against
 * {@link #PROVIDER_IDEMPOTENCY_WINDOW}. Changing the backoff, the cap or the
 * attempt ceiling past the point where a retry could fall outside the window
 * fails that test rather than quietly weakening the guarantee.
 *
 * <p><b>What is outside the window is outside the guarantee.</b> An operator who
 * manually clears {@code abandoned_at} on a dead row more than 24 hours after it
 * was queued may cause a duplicate delivery: the key has expired at Resend, and
 * there is no provider-side "was this already delivered" lookup to consult
 * instead. Resend does not offer one, so nothing here pretends otherwise. A
 * manual replay of a stale row is a decision to risk a second copy — usually the
 * right decision for an account-closure notice, and the operator's to make
 * knowingly.
 *
 * <h2>Giving up</h2>
 *
 * <p>After {@link #maxAttempts} the row is abandoned rather than retried
 * forever. A permanently rejected address — a typo'd domain, a suppressed
 * recipient — is not made deliverable by a hundredth attempt, and a queue that
 * never retires anything is a queue whose head is eventually a message nobody
 * can send. The row is kept, with its error, because "we could not tell them"
 * is itself something worth being able to find out.
