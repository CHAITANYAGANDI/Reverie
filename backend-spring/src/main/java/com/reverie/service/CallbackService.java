/**
 * Handles internal callbacks from the FastAPI worker: relays status updates to
 * the frontend and persists the final {@link MeetingBriefResult}. Idempotent —
 * re-running the pipeline (reprocess) replaces prior results.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every callback names the run it is reporting, and is judged against
 * the run the meeting is on.</strong> Kafka delivery is at-least-once and the
 * worker holds its offset until Spring has taken a terminal outcome, so a
 * callback that arrives after its response was lost arrives again — and it can
 * arrive after a person has already asked for the meeting to be reprocessed.
 *
 * <p>Without the check, that late arrival read {@code processing_attempt} off
 * the row and became whatever run was current: it would have spent the new
 * run's AI-minute claim, taken the new run's notification keys, and written a
 * stale transcript over a fresh one — while the run actually in flight found
 * its own effects already claimed and landed silently. The attempt now travels
 * with the work, from {@code meeting_uploaded} through the worker's retries to
 * here, and this is where it is compared.
