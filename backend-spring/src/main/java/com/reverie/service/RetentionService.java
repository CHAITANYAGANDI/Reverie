/**
 * Throwing things away on a schedule, because somebody asked us to.
 *
 * <p>Two dials, not one. "How long do you keep the recording of my voice" is
 * asked by the people who were in the meeting; "how long do you keep the notes"
 * is asked by the person who owns the account. Thirty days and forever is a
 * coherent and common answer to that pair, and a single number cannot express
 * it. Both default to null — keep everything — because a retention policy that
 * switched itself on during a deploy would delete data nobody agreed to lose.
 *
 * <p><strong>Age is measured from when the meeting was created</strong>, not
 * from when it was last opened. Last-touched retention sounds kinder and is the
 * wrong promise: it means the recording of a sensitive conversation survives
 * indefinitely precisely because people keep going back to it. What is being
 * promised here is "we do not keep this beyond N days", and only the creation
 * date can keep that promise.
 *
 * <p><strong>The narrower rule is checked first.</strong> A meeting past both
 * cut-offs is deleted whole and never counted twice — the audio inside it went
 * with it, and reporting "1 recording and 1 meeting deleted" for one meeting is
 * a lie about the size of what happened.

     *
     * <p>{@code preview} answers "what would a pass on date D delete", which is
     * cumulative — everything already overdue plus everything newly due. Asked
     * with the clock a week forward it gives one lump with no way to tell which
     * day any of it belongs to, and a warning keyed off that lump can only be
     * deduplicated by <em>when it was sent</em>. That is the rule this replaces,
     * and it is wrong in exactly the case the warning exists for: warn on Monday
     * about next Monday's batch, and the batch that crosses the horizon on
     * Tuesday is suppressed for six days and then deleted, unwarned.
     *
     * <p>This splits the window by the day the deletion actually lands, so each
     * batch is a thing with an identity — {@code (user, date)} — that a message
     * can be keyed to. Two batches a day apart get two warnings; the same batch
     * gets one however often the job runs.
     *
     * <h2>The arithmetic, stated once</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@link #olderThan} erases a meeting on the first day D where
     * {@code createdAt < (D - days) at midnight UTC}, which is
     * {@code created + days + 1}. That is the whole of the date rule and it is
     * derived here rather than approximated, so a warning cannot name a day the
     * pass disagrees with.
     *
     * <p>A meeting can appear twice, on two different days, and that is correct:
     * with a short audio window and a long meeting window the recording goes
     * first and the meeting goes later. Both are irreversible and both deserve
     * their own notice. It appears once when the whole meeting goes first or on
     * the same day — the pass counts it once there too, because the audio goes
     * with it.
