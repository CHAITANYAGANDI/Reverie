/**
 * Throw away outbox rows that have done their job.
 *
 * <p>The outbox is a queue, not a record. Once a row is published its only
 * remaining value is answering "did this event go out, and when" during the
 * hours after something looked wrong — and nothing in Reverie reads it for any
 * other purpose: no endpoint exposes it, no report counts it, no replay reads
 * it, and it is not part of the audit trail. What a meeting actually did is in
 * {@code audit_logs} and in the meeting's own status and error message, both of
 * which outlive this table on purpose. Left alone the rows accumulate forever,
 * one per upload and one per reprocess, each carrying its full event payload.
 *
 * <p><strong>Seven days.</strong> Long enough that a problem noticed on Monday
 * can still be traced back through the weekend that caused it, which is the
 * realistic support question; short enough that the table stays a queue. The
 * pipeline itself finishes in minutes, so anything longer is keeping records to
 * answer questions nobody asks — thirty days was the obvious number and it is
 * four times more history than the thing being diagnosed takes to happen.
 *
 * <p><strong>Only published rows.</strong> Never pending ones, which are work
 * that has not happened yet. And never retired ones: those are kept
 * <em>deliberately</em>, with their payload and their error, because a retired
 * event is the record of a meeting that did not get processed and is the one
 * thing here somebody may need to read months later. If they should ever expire
 * too, that is a separate policy with a separate number, not a side effect of
 * this one.
 *
 * <p><strong>Batched.</strong> A single unbounded {@code DELETE} on a table that
 * has been quietly growing since the first deploy is one long lock and one large
 * transaction; a few thousand at a time is neither. It cannot collide with the
 * relay in any case — the relay locks only {@code published = false} rows and
 * this touches only {@code published = true} ones, so the two never want the
 * same row — but the bounded loop also means this job is never the reason a
 * connection is held for a long time.
