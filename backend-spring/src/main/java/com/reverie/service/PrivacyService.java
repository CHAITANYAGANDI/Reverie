/**
 * The page that answers "what do you have of mine, and how do I make it stop".
 *
 * <p>Reverie had the architecture for this and none of the controls. Row-level
 * security means one account cannot read another's rows; the audio sits in a
 * private bucket reachable only through a URL we sign for fifteen minutes; a
 * share link is opt-in, per meeting, and revocable. All true, all invisible, and
 * the settings page's "Danger zone" popped a toast saying deletion was not
 * implemented. A privacy claim nobody can check from inside the product is
 * marketing.
 *
 * <p>So everything here is either a count of real rows or a fact read back from
 * the thing it describes. Nothing on this page is a sentence we wrote about
 * ourselves.
 *
 * <p><strong>On what this deliberately does not do.</strong> Closing an account
 * is immediate and irreversible. The obvious alternative — mark it deleted, hold
 * it for thirty days, let people change their minds — is what most products do
 * and is the wrong trade here: it means answering "yes, that is deleted" while
 * the data is still on disk and still restorable by whoever runs the servers,
 * which is precisely the answer this page exists to make true. The safety net
 * that replaces it is the export sitting immediately above the button.
