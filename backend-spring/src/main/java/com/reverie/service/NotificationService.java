/**
 * What Reverie says about its own work.
 *
 * <p>Every wording lives in this one class. The alternative — each caller
 * writing its own sentence at the point the event happens — is how a product
 * ends up saying "Transcription complete", "Transcript is ready" and "Your
 * transcript has finished processing" in three places for the same event.
 *
 * <p><strong>Three rules keep the bell worth looking at.</strong>
 *
 * <p><em>Muted kinds are never written, not merely hidden.</em> Writing a row
 * and filtering it on read means switching a kind back on floods the list with
 * a month of things somebody had already decided they did not care about.
 *
 * <p><em>Recurring kinds carry a dedupe key.</em> An overdue task is overdue
 * again tomorrow and a shared link is opened by everyone it was sent to. Without
 * a key the list is a firehose, and a firehose is uninstalled by simply not
 * clicking the bell again.
 *
 * <p><em>Nothing here may break what it is reporting on.</em> A notification is
 * commentary. It is written inside the caller's transaction so that a rolled-back
 * meeting leaves no notification about itself, and the socket ping is deferred
 * to after that commit so a browser is never told about something that did not
 * end up happening.

     * tell you when the notes are ready" spent a row of the bell promising the
     * row that follows it.
