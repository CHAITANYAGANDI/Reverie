/**
 * Starter questions for the workspace chat, cached per user.
 *
 * <p>Unlike a meeting's, these have no moment to be generated at — a workspace
 * is never "finished processing" — so they are made on request and kept until
 * one of two things makes them wrong:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A meeting arrived.</b> Suggestions that name last week's meetings
 *       read as a system that has lost track of what the user is doing, and a
 *       new upload is exactly when someone looks at this page.
 *   <li><b>Time passed.</b> Otherwise a user whose archive is stable would see
 *       the same three questions for ever, which is the hard-coded list again
 *       with extra steps.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Generation is never allowed to fail the request. The chips are a
 * convenience on a page that works without them, so an ai-service outage
 * returns whatever was cached — and an empty list if nothing was, which the UI
 * renders as its own static prompts.
