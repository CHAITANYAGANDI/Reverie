     * <p><b>This is the gate for self-only mode, and it is the only one that
     * works.</b> Hiding the sign-up button is not access control: Clerk creates
     * an account for anybody who reaches its hosted flow, the token it mints is
     * valid, and this method is where Reverie decides that subject deserves a
     * row. Refusing here means a stranger gets no account rather than an account
     * they are then refused the use of -- and the difference is a real user id,
     * with real rows, left behind for every later request to act as.
     *
     * <p>Before the lookup, deliberately. {@link SelfOnlyAccess} covers every
     * caller of this method -- the HTTP filter, the STOMP interceptor, and
     * whatever is written next -- rather than each of them remembering. It also
     * runs before the insert below, so a refused subject touches the repository
     * not at all and leaves nothing behind.
     *
     * <h2>Why the creation is one statement</h2>
     *
     * <p>A browser opening the app for the first time fires several requests at
     * once, all authenticating the same brand-new subject. Read-then-save gave
     * every one of them an empty lookup, so every one of them inserted; one won
     * and the others returned 500 against {@code users_clerk_user_id_key}. The
     * account was created correctly -- the constraint saw to that -- but the
     * user's first page load was mostly errors and a refresh cleared it, which
     * is the worst way for a bug to present.
     *
     * <p>{@link UserRepository#insertIfAbsent} makes the decision atomically in
     * Postgres. The loser of the race inserts nothing and reads the winner's
     * row, so every concurrent caller leaves with the same user id and none of
     * them fails. Nothing is caught and retried: a uniqueness violation would
     * surface at flush and leave this transaction already aborted, which is
     * exactly the situation there is no recovering from inside it.
     *
     * <p>An account that already exists -- which is every request after the
     * first -- takes the single lookup and stops, same as before.
