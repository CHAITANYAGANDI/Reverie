/**
 * Fires the nightly retention pass.
 *
 * <p>Separate from the service it calls: the scheduler thread has no
 * authenticated user, so the work needs {@link TenantContext#runAsSystem}, and
 * a bean that both schedules itself and establishes its own tenant is one whose
 * transaction boundary is easy to get quietly wrong. It also means a test can
 * apply a policy without a clock.
 *
 * <p>Three in the morning UTC. It is now the only scheduled pass over every
 * account — the eight o'clock digest it was timed away from went with the mail
 * in V56 — so the hour is free to be simply a quiet one.
 *
 * <p>{@code reverie.retention.enabled=false} switches it off entirely, which is
 * what a restored-from-backup environment wants before anybody has looked at it:
 * a copy of production waking up and re-running last month's deletions against
 * data somebody is trying to recover is the failure mode worth a flag.
