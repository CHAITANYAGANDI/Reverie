/**
 * Drains the mail outbox, and clears up after itself.
 *
 * <p><b>Safe on every instance.</b> Each tick claims its rows with
 * {@code FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED}, so two backends divide the backlog rather
 * than both sending all of it. There is no leader election and nothing to
 * configure — an instance that is up relays, an instance that is not simply
 * does not. The same arrangement {@code OutboxRelay} has, and the reasoning is
 * spelled out in {@code OutboxClaimSql}.
 *
 * <p><b>An outage is a delay.</b> A message that cannot be delivered records
 * the attempt and a time to try again and is not claimed before then, so an
 * unreachable provider produces a handful of warnings that thin out to one an
 * hour rather than one per second per instance forever. The schedule is a
 * column, so every instance agrees on it and a restart does not reset it.
 *
 * <p>Runs in system context: this is infrastructure with no user behind it, and
 * {@code mail_outbox} is drainable only by the system role under the V64
 * policy. The context is established here, outside the transaction, because the
 * connection is stamped when the transaction borrows it —
 * {@link MailDispatcher} holds the transactional half for exactly that reason.

     *
     * <p>{@code mail_outbox} has no foreign key to {@code users} and must not
     * have one — the account-closure message is delivered after the row it
     * would reference is gone. The cost is exactly what it sounds like: an
     * address, a subject and a body outlive {@code closeAccount}, which has
     * otherwise erased everything about the account. So the lifetime is written
     * down and it is short.
     *
     * <p><b>Seven days for delivered.</b> A delivered row is a receipt; the
     * message has arrived and the person has it. Long enough to answer "did
     * that go out on Tuesday", short enough that a closed account's address is
     * not sitting here a month later.
     *
     * <p><b>Thirty days for abandoned.</b> Longer than delivered, which looks
     * backwards for a privacy lifetime and is the deliberate choice: an
     * abandoned row is the record that somebody was <em>not</em> told
     * something, and for the closure notice it is the only trace the notice
     * failed. A week is not long enough for anybody to notice, ask and look.
     *
     * <p>Both are bounded-batch deletes, so two relays running this at once
     * delete disjoint sets and neither holds a long lock — the same property
     * {@code OutboxPurge} relies on.
