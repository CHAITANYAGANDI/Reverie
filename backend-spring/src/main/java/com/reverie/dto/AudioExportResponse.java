/**
 * Where the converted recording is, or why it is not there yet.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not just a URL</h2>
 *
 * <p>Converting an hour of audio takes tens of seconds. A synchronous endpoint
 * that did it would hold a request thread for the whole of that and then lose
 * the race anyway: the reverse proxy, most corporate proxies and every browser
 * give up well before the longest recording Reverie accepts is finished. The
 * failure mode is the worst kind — the conversion completes, the object is
 * written, and the user is looking at a timeout.
 *
 * <p>So the endpoint answers immediately with one of three states and the client
 * asks again. {@code preparing} is not an error and must not be rendered as one;
 * {@code failed} is, and carries a sentence written to be read rather than a
 * status code.
 *
 * <p>{@code ready} is the same shape as {@link AudioDownloadResponse} on
 * purpose — a short-lived presigned link straight to object storage, because the
 * derivative is exactly as large as the original and proxying it through a
 * request thread would be the same mistake in a new place.
