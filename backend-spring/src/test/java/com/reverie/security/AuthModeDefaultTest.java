/**
 * Which way the authentication switch falls when nobody sets it.
 *
 * <p>Dev mode reads an {@code X-Dev-User} header and becomes whoever it names.
 * That is exactly right for running the stack with no Clerk account, and it is
 * an authentication bypass available to anyone who can send a header.
 *
 * <p>The default used to be dev. So an unset, empty or misspelt
 * {@code REVERIE_AUTH_MODE} — a compose file edited in a hurry, a variable
 * that did not reach the container, a typo — selected the bypass, silently, and
 * the application started perfectly and served every request as whoever asked.
 * Nothing about that failure looks like a failure.
 *
 * <p>It defaults to clerk now, and the cost of the opposite mistake is a wall of
 * 401s: obvious within seconds, and nobody's data is exposed while it lasts.
 * That asymmetry is the whole argument, and it lives in one character of a
 * {@code @Value} expression, which is why it is pinned here.
