/**
 * Start the whole thing once and see whether it comes up.
 *
 * <p>The companion to {@code ApplicationWiringTest}, which asks whether Spring
 * can pick a constructor. This asks the rest: do the beans those constructors
 * want actually exist, does the configuration bind, do the repository interfaces
 * produce working proxies, and does Flyway leave a schema Hibernate agrees with.
 * None of that can be answered without really starting.
 *
 * <p><strong>Needs a PostgreSQL, and skips without one.</strong> Same switch as
 * {@code OutboxClaimConcurrencyTest}: set {@code REVERIE_IT_DB_URL} and it
 * runs. There is no in-memory substitute available — the schema is fifty-odd
 * Flyway migrations of PostgreSQL, including {@code pgvector} columns, row-level
 * security policies and partial indexes, and every one of the native queries in
 * this codebase is PostgreSQL. An H2 that could load it would not be testing the
 * thing that runs.
 *
 * <p>It connects as the <em>owner</em> role, because Flyway runs on startup and
 * needs to. That is what the deployment does too.
 *
 * <h2>What is faked, and what that costs</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>Kafka: not connected.</strong> The bootstrap address points nowhere
 * and the admin client's timeouts are turned down so it gives up in a second
 * instead of thirty. This is honest rather than convenient — {@code KafkaAdmin}
 * is already non-fatal by design, so an unreachable broker is a supported
 * startup condition, and the beans that matter here ({@code KafkaTemplate}, the
 * relay, the publisher) are constructed either way. What it does not prove is
 * that the SASL credentials work, which is a deployment question rather than a
 * wiring one.
 *
 * <p><strong>Object storage and the AI service: not called.</strong> Their
 * clients are built from configuration at construction and open no connection,
 * so they are real beans pointed at addresses nobody dials.
 *
 * <p><strong>The web layer: not started.</strong> {@code webEnvironment = NONE},
 * because the question is whether the beans exist, not whether they serve.
 *
 * <p>So: this proves the application context assembles against a real schema. It
 * does not prove the deployment's credentials, network or brokers are right.
