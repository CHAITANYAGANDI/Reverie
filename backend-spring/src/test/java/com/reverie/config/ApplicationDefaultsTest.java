/**
 * What {@code application.yml} resolves to when the environment says nothing.
 *
 * <h2>The bug this exists for</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code AuthenticationFilter}, {@code ClerkTokens} and
 * {@code DeploymentCheck} all declare {@code @Value("${reverie.auth-mode:clerk}")},
 * and {@link com.reverie.security.AuthModeDefaultTest} pins that they fail
 * closed. All of it was dead. A {@code @Value} default applies only when the
 * property is <em>absent</em>, and {@code application.yml} said
 * {@code auth-mode: ${REVERIE_AUTH_MODE:dev}} — which made it present, in
 * every profile, resolving to {@code dev}.
 *
 * <p>So there were two defaults for one decision, in two files, and the weaker
 * one won silently. Nothing failed: the unit tests passed, because they
 * construct the filter with an explicit mode and never go near this file.
 *
 * <p>That is the gap this closes. It resolves the real YAML the real way, with
 * no environment behind it, and asserts what Spring would actually hand the
 * application on a machine where nobody set anything.
