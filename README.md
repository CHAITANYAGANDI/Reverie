# Reverie AI

> Turn meeting audio into accurate transcripts, concise summaries, decisions, risks, and trackable action items.

Reverie AI is a production-style, multi-service SaaS. Bring a meeting in —
import audio or video, paste a YouTube link, upload typed-up minutes, or record
one from your microphone — and it transcribes, summarizes, and extracts
decisions / action items / risks, streams live progress over WebSockets, and
tracks commitments and decision drift *across* meetings.

| Service | Stack | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend/` | Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind, shadcn/ui | 3000 |
| `backend-spring/` | Java 21, Spring Boot 3, Spring Security, Spring Kafka, JPA, Flyway | 8080 |
| `ai-service/` | Python 3.12, FastAPI, OpenAI, aiokafka | 8000 |
| infra | PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector, Confluent Cloud (Kafka), Cloudflare R2 | — |

Transcription is chosen separately from the LLM, because the two are not the
same decision: AssemblyAI diarizes, Whisper does not. `auto` follows whatever
`AI_PROVIDER` is set to.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env         # defaults run with NO external keys (dev auth + mock AI)
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend:  http://localhost:3000
- Spring API: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health · Swagger: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- AI service: http://localhost:8000/health · Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

The stack runs end-to-end out of the box: **dev auth** (no Clerk account needed)
and **mock AI** (deterministic transcript/summary, no OpenAI key). To enable the
real pipeline set `AI_PROVIDER=openai` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and/or
`REVERIE_AUTH_MODE=clerk` with Clerk env vars. See [.env.example](.env.example).

> A dev session has no identity provider and therefore **no email address**, so
> every automatic email is correctly refused rather than sent nowhere. Set a
> recap address through `PATCH /api/v1/preferences` to exercise them.

### Demoing Meeting Memory without an API key

The mock provider returns a three-meeting *narrative*, not one fixed transcript,
so the cross-meeting features have something real to find. Upload any three
audio files named `week1.*`, `week2.*`, `week3.*` — a digit in the filename picks
the week, so the story replays in order:

| Week | What happens | What memory detects |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Three promises made; S3 + Whisper decided | 3 commitments opened |
| 2 | JWT done, Kafka consumer slipped, Whisper → Deepgram | `FULFILLED`, `SLIPPED`, `CONTRADICTS` |
| 3 | Mock-provider work cancelled, benchmark completed, S3 confirmed | `CANCELLED`, `FULFILLED`, `REAFFIRMS` |

Files without a digit are hashed to a week, so reprocessing the same audio is
stable. `DROPPED` needs a promise to go unmentioned across three later meetings,
so it takes a fourth upload to see.

## Development

The ai-service has its own README with local (non-Docker) run instructions:
[ai-service](ai-service/README.md). The other two run with `npm run dev` and
`mvn spring-boot:run`.

`docker compose up` here builds the three application containers and nothing
else — there are no local infrastructure containers. The Postgres, Kafka and
object-storage endpoints a development stack talks to are whatever `.env`
points at, reached over the internet. That is a local-development choice and
says nothing about production, which self-hosts its database on the Oracle VM;
see [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md).

### Tests

| Suite | Count | Run it |
|---|---|---|
| `backend-spring` (JUnit) | 715 | `cd backend-spring && mvn test` |
| `frontend` (Vitest) | 890 | `cd frontend && npm test` |
| `ai-service` (pytest) | 361 | `cd ai-service && pytest` |

Counts are from a full run on 19 Aug 2026, not an estimate. `mvn test` reports
`BUILD SUCCESS` against stale classes if `backend-spring/target` is left behind
by a previous run — delete it first when a change should have broken something
and did not.

## Tech / design highlights

- **Design patterns**: Strategy + Factory + Adapter (AI and transcription
  providers), Repository, DTO, Builder (brief response), Observer (Spring
  application events), Outbox (reliable events, claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP
  LOCKED` so it is safe on every instance), Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j around
  AI calls).
- **Security**: Clerk JWT validation, Postgres row-level security, private S3
  buckets + short-lived presigned URLs, audit logs, plan-based file/usage limits.
- **No email at all**: Reverie contacts nobody. The recap, the morning
  deadline reminder, the Monday review and the comment/highlight notices were
  removed in V56 — the settings tab that switched them on had already gone, which
  left senders nobody could reach. The notification bell is the only channel, and
  it is the one that never needed an address.
- **Server-side request forgery**: one user-supplied URL is fetched server-side,
  and it is defended by a host allowlist enforced twice — in `MeetingService`
  before the event is published, and in `app/ingest.py` before yt-dlp sees it.

## What is not here, stated honestly

- **Integration tests exist but are opt-in.** Three suites run against a real
  PostgreSQL and are skipped unless `REVERIE_IT_DB_URL` is set:
  `OutboxClaimConcurrencyTest` (row claiming, retry, poison events, purge
  safety, RLS), `MeetingAttemptAllocationTest` (concurrent reprocess) and
  `ApplicationContextSmokeTest` (the Spring context against a migrated schema).
  Everything else is a unit test against mocks. Testcontainers is declared in
  `backend-spring/pom.xml` and still unused — the suites take a database URL
  instead, because the build itself runs inside a container with no Docker
  socket.
- **No load tests.** The k6 scripts described in
  [docs/load-testing-report.md](docs/load-testing-report.md) have not been written.
- **No provider is exercised live.** The AssemblyAI adapter has tests, but they
  cover response *mapping* — millisecond-to-second conversion, speaker-label
  normalisation — against recorded payloads. No test makes a real call to any
  provider, including OpenAI.
- **Two capabilities have no interface.** The seven email switches and the
  notification mute switches are settable only through `PATCH /preferences`:
  recap mail, the weekly digest and task reminders still send on whatever is
  stored, and nothing in the app can turn them off. There were five. Retention
  and closing the account are now on Account Settings — General, and the
  account export was removed from the server rather than left unreachable.
- **Erasure has one grain in the UI, and three on the server.** `DELETE` of a
  meeting's audio and of its transcript both work, and the retention job calls
  them; the ⋯ menu offers only "Delete this meeting". A meeting can still turn
  up with its recording already erased, so the page keeps the line saying when
  that happened.
- **A meeting's spoken language cannot be corrected after the fact.**
  `POST /meetings/:id/language` re-transcribes the audio under a language you
  name, and nothing calls it. It was a ⋯ menu item sitting beside the
  translation picker; two controls both saying "language", one of which
  silently destroyed hand-typed transcript corrections. Removed rather than
  renamed. The import dialog's language picker sets the *account* default, not
  a per-meeting one, so today the language is chosen before a meeting is
  enqueued or not at all. "Reprocess meeting" re-runs the pipeline, with
  whatever language the meeting already has.
- **A folder's chat is unreachable, not deleted.** `POST /projects/:id/chat` and
  the whole `PRJ-` scope still work; the UI for them was removed, so existing
  history is stranded rather than erased.
- **Single account per workspace.** No teams, no members, no invitations — which
  is why there is no "someone commented on your meeting", and why the comment
  and highlight emails describe your own activity back to you, capped at one a
  day.
