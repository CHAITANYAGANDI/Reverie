"""RAG service: chunk + embed transcripts into pgvector, retrieve, and answer.

Owns the transcript_chunks table directly (async psycopg). Vectors are passed
as `::vector` string casts, so no pgvector Python adapter is required. When
PG_HOST is unset the service disables itself gracefully (chat returns a friendly
message) so the app still boots.

**Chunks belong to a processing run, and a run can only touch its own.**

This table is the one piece of a meeting's derived state that Spring does not
write. The worker indexes it directly, during processing, before the result
callback exists -- so the attempt check inside `applyResult` comes far too late
to protect it. A redelivered attempt-1 execution whose result was about to be
rejected as stale would already have run `DELETE FROM transcript_chunks WHERE
meeting_id = ?` and written the old transcript back, and "ask this meeting"
would answer out of the text the user had just asked to have replaced.

Every row carries `processing_attempt` (V58), and indexing deletes only rows at
or below its own generation. That alone was not enough. It stops an old run
reaching a *newer* generation, and does nothing in the window between somebody
pressing reprocess and the new run finishing -- because in that window there is
no newer generation, and generation 1 is not a superseded copy of anything, it
is the transcript the user is chatting with. A redelivered attempt-1 execution
would delete it and write its own text back over it, including over corrections
somebody had typed into it by hand.

So the write is guarded where the mutation happens, by holding the meeting row:

    BEGIN
      SELECT processing_attempt FROM meetings WHERE id = ? FOR NO KEY UPDATE
      if it is not this run's number -> commit nothing and leave
      DELETE the generations at or below this one
      INSERT this one
    COMMIT

`MeetingService.reprocess` advances `processing_attempt` with an ordinary
`UPDATE`, which takes the same row at `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` strength, so exactly
one of the two orders happens and both are correct: either the index commits
first and the reprocess waits (this run genuinely was current when it wrote), or
the reprocess commits first and the index reads the new number and does nothing.
There is no interleaving in which a stale run's delete lands.

`FOR NO KEY UPDATE` rather than `FOR UPDATE` deliberately: it conflicts with the
reprocess, which is the point, without blocking the `FOR KEY SHARE` that every
insert referencing this meeting takes -- a segment, an action item, a
notification -- none of which have anything to do with which run is current.

**Nothing slow happens under that lock.** Chunking and embedding -- the network
call to the model -- are finished before the connection is checked out. What the
lock covers is one delete and the inserts.

Retrieval reads the newest generation present for each meeting -- deliberately
not "the meeting's current attempt". A reprocess does not delete the transcript,
the summary or the action items while it runs, and chat should not go blind
either: the previous run stays answerable until the new one lands.

        """Answer a question grounded in EVERY meeting the user owns.

        Retrieval is filtered by `user_id`, so a user can never be grounded in
        another user's transcript. `meeting_ids`, when given, narrows the search
        to a subset (e.g. "only these three calls").

        `mode` decides how hard to look, and the two differ in three ways so
        that neither is a worse version of the other:

        * **express** — one pass at `rag_workspace_top_k` passages, from at most
          `rag_max_passages_per_meeting` of any one meeting, written short.
        * **advanced** — `rag_workspace_deep_top_k` passages over a wider
          candidate scan, more of each meeting allowed, and written to cover
          every theme the evidence supports. Costs proportionally more context
          and time, which is why it is a choice rather than the default.

        Advanced deliberately no longer forces enumeration. It used to, so
        "what does JWT mean here?" came back as a single bullet under the line
        "Total: 1." Depth is about evidence; whether the answer is a counted
        list is about what was asked.

        The commitment and decision ledgers are in both. They are the complete
        record rather than a retrieved sample, and withholding them from the
        cheaper mode would make it confidently wrong about what is outstanding
        rather than merely shallower.

        `history_days` is the account's own floor on how far back retrieval
        reaches. It bounds transcripts and deliberately not the ledgers, for the
        same reason: a task owed since March is still owed, and dropping it
        because its transcript is out of window would make the answer wrong
        rather than narrower.

        Two things here decide how good retrieval is.

        **The speaker prefix.** Each turn is rendered "Speaker 1: ..." exactly as
        the transcript itself is (see the adapter's `_join`). Without it the
        passage says only *what* was said, so "I'll have it by Friday" retrieves
        with no way to tell who promised it — and first-person commitments are
        most of what anyone asks a meeting about.

        **The overlap.** Passages are cut on a character budget, and an answer
        lying across a cut used to be split in half, leaving neither side able to
        support it. Consecutive passages now share a tail, so a boundary no
        longer falls in the middle of the only sentence that mattered.
