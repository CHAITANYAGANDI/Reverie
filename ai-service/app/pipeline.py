"""Pipeline orchestration: transcribe -> (summarize | extract) in parallel.

The pipeline is provider-agnostic (it depends only on the ports) and is used by
both the synchronous HTTP endpoints and the async Kafka worker. Progress is
surfaced through an optional `progress_hook(StatusEvent)` so the worker
can fan each stage out to Kafka + the Spring callback, while HTTP callers can
ignore it.

Latency note: summarization and action-item extraction take the same transcript
and are independent of one another, so they run concurrently — the analysis
stage costs the slower of the two rather than their sum. The
`transcript_hook` fires the moment the transcript exists, which lets the worker
start RAG indexing in the background while analysis is still running.
