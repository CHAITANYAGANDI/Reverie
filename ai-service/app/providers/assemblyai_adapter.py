"""AssemblyAI speech-to-text: the canonical transcript.

This is the authoritative path. The browser also runs a live stream during the
meeting (see `app/streaming.py` and `frontend/lib/use-live-transcript.ts`), but
that is provisional and is replaced wholesale by whatever this returns. The two
optimise different things on purpose: streaming buys latency at the cost of
context, and this one has the entire recording to look at, so it wins.

Three properties of this provider's response are load-bearing and easy to get
silently wrong:

* **Timestamps are milliseconds, and everything downstream wants seconds.**
  The audio player, word highlighting, citation deep-links and `_duration_of`
  all read `Segment.start/end` as seconds. A missed conversion
  does not raise; it makes a 40-minute meeting look 11 hours long.
* **Speakers are letters ("A", "B"), and they are cluster ids, not positions.**
  "D" does not mean "the fourth person" — it means whichever cluster the
  provider happened to put that voice in. Renumbering them meeting-locally is
  `app.diarization.CanonicalSpeakers`, and skipping it is how two people came
  to display as Speaker 1 and Speaker 4.
* **Attribution is per word, not only per utterance.** Reading only the
  utterance's label loses a short interjection inside a longer turn.
* **An unrecognisable speaker is not Speaker 1.** It used to be. See
  `app.diarization.UNKNOWN_SPEAKER`.

## What is sent, and why each field is conditional

Nothing here is sent unconditionally except the things that are always true.
The provider validates combinations and refuses some of them outright — one
pairing (`speakers_expected` with `speaker_options`) returns a 400 reading
"Both speaker_options and speakers_expected can not be used in the same
request" — so the request builder is a pure function with its own tests rather
than a dict assembled inline.

`keyterms_prompt` and `prompt` replace `word_boost`/`boost_param` on the
Universal-3 family. Contrary to what the docs imply, `word_boost` is *not*
rejected by `universal-3-5-pro` — a job submitted with it is accepted and
completes, verified against the live API — but it is the superseded channel and
the ceiling is far lower, so it is used only when universal-2 is the only model
in play.

## Failure is not an empty transcript

The old behaviour on any exception was to return an empty result, on the theory
that a meeting with no transcript is recoverable and a crashed worker is not.
That is right for a network blip and wrong for a malformed request: a 400
became a meeting that looked like it had been recorded in silence, and nothing
anywhere said otherwise. Configuration errors now raise, so the meeting fails
visibly with the provider's own message on it. Transport errors still retry,
and still degrade rather than crash.
