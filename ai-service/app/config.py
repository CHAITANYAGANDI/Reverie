    # coroutine on the event loop, so it stops being sent the moment something
    # else refuses to yield. That is what happened -- ECAPA speaker refinement
    # ran synchronously on the loop for nine minutes, the heartbeat coroutine
    # was never scheduled, the broker declared the member dead at ten seconds,
    # the group rebalanced, the hand-committed offset stayed put, and the
    # meeting came back to be transcribed again. Twice, at full price.
    #
    # The real fix is that the blocking work now runs in a thread
    # (`speaker_identity._voiceprints`), so the loop stays
    # free. This is the belt beside it: 45 seconds rather than aiokafka's
    # 10-second default, so a garbage collection, a model load or a burst of
    # GIL contention cannot cost a transcription. It is still far below
    # `max_poll_interval_ms`, so a worker that has genuinely died is still
    # noticed in under a minute rather than in an hour and a half.
