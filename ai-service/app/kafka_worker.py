"""Resilient Kafka worker (aiokafka).

Consumes `meeting_uploaded`, runs the full pipeline, and posts every stage to
Spring's status callback. On completion it posts the `MeetingBriefResult` to
Spring's result callback; on failure it posts a FAILED status the same way.

Consume-only. The worker used to also produce a `StatusEvent` to a topic per
stage, and `meeting_processing_failed` on the way out. Nothing consumed them
except a Spring listener that logged them, while the HTTP callbacks beside each
one did the actual work -- persisting the transcript, the summary, and the
FAILED state. The topics were deleted; the callbacks are untouched.

**Offsets are committed by hand, after the outcome is durable.**

This used to run with `enable_auto_commit=True`, which was silent data loss.
aiokafka's background committer advances the offset from the consumer position,
and the position moves when a message is handed to the loop -- not when the loop
finishes with it. A twelve-minute transcription was therefore acknowledged about
five seconds in, so a worker that died at minute six came back with the offset
already committed and never processed that meeting again. It stayed QUEUED
forever: no retry, no FAILED state, nothing in the bell. The outbox went to real
trouble to deliver the job at least once and the consumer threw it away.

Now nothing is acknowledged until the meeting has reached a state Spring has
written down:

  * success  -- committed once `post_result` is accepted. That callback is what
                persists the transcript, summary, action items and READY status,
                so it *is* the terminal state. The READY status post after it is
                a WebSocket courtesy, and its failure does not hold the offset:
                the browser polls the meeting anyway, and redelivering a whole
                transcription to re-send one frame would cost real money.
  * failure  -- committed once the FAILED status callback is accepted, because
                that is what records the error and tells the user.
  * neither  -- not committed. The message is redelivered.

That makes delivery honestly at-least-once, so the effects on the Spring side
are idempotent per processing attempt (V57). This is not exactly-once and does
not pretend to be: a redelivery re-runs transcription, and the provider bills
for it.

**The processing run travels with the message.** `meeting_uploaded` carries the
`processingAttempt` Spring allocated when it created the job, and every callback
this worker sends quotes it back. It is read once, from the message, and never
recomputed: retries, redeliveries and a second pass through the audio-fallback
are all the same run, and only `MeetingService.reprocess` ever starts a new one.
The number is what lets Spring tell a result that is late from a result that is
obsolete, which are the same HTTP request and opposite instructions.

**The consumer stays in the group while a meeting is being processed**, and
there are two separate ways it used not to.

`max_poll_interval_ms` is configured rather than defaulted, because aiokafka's
default is five minutes and Reverie supports meetings that take longer than
that. Its heartbeat task measures `fetcher_idle_time` — time since the last
message was handed to this loop — and leaves the group once that passes the
interval, so a long transcription used to be evicted mid-run, fail its commit,
and be redelivered to be transcribed again, for ever. See `Settings`.

That fixed the poll timer and left the *session* timer, which is a different
clock and was the one that kept firing. The heartbeat is a coroutine on this
event loop, and speaker refinement used to run its ffmpeg decode and its ECAPA
forward passes synchronously on that same loop — nine minutes in one observed
meeting. The heartbeat was never scheduled, the broker declared the member dead
after ten seconds, the group rebalanced, and the offset went uncommitted: the
meeting was redelivered and transcribed again. One upload was transcribed three
times, and its status walked backwards from EXTRACTING to TRANSCRIBING in front
of the person waiting for it. No timeout value can fix that, because the problem
is a coroutine that is never given the loop; the blocking work runs in a thread
now (`speaker_identity._voiceprints`), and
`kafka_session_timeout_ms` is the margin beside it.

**A redelivery no longer costs a transcription.** Before any work is done,
`_handle` asks Spring what state the meeting is in — see
`SpringCallbackClient.job_state`. A meeting that was deleted, that already
finished this run, or that a reprocess has moved past is committed and skipped.
The check fails open: if Spring cannot be reached the message is processed,
because a meeting billed twice is a cost and a meeting never processed is a bug.

Connection is resilient: if the broker is unreachable at startup the worker logs
and retries with exponential backoff — it never crashes the app.
