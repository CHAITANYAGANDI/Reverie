"""Audio retrieval — and, better, audio *not* retrieved.

Two ways to get a recording to a transcription provider:

1. Download the whole file here, then upload the whole file there. Two
   transfers of an hour of audio through a worker that does nothing with the
   bytes but pass them on.
2. Hand the provider a URL and let it fetch the file once, directly.

The second is what `presigned_get_url` exists for. The bucket stays private —
this mints a signature valid for minutes, for one object, for GET only — so
nothing is made public to save a hop. Where a signature cannot be produced
(no S3 credentials, a provider that will not fetch) the byte path is still
there and still correct.

The URL is a credential for one object and is never logged.

    did before rather than fail.

    <p><b>The lifetime is the whole point.</b> An hour is long enough for a
    provider to queue and fetch a long recording, and short enough that a URL
    recovered from anywhere afterwards opens nothing.

    <p><b>Requires `s3_public_endpoint` explicitly.</b> It used to fall back to
    `s3_endpoint`, and that fallback caused the exact failure the docstring
    above was warning about: a URL signed against `http://minio:9000` is
    perfectly valid, completely unreachable from outside the compose network,
    and AssemblyAI answers it with "could not connect to the host" after
    accepting the job. Three retries later the meeting had no transcript and
    nothing on screen said why.
