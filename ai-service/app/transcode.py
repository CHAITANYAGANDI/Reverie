"""Turning a recording into an MP3, once.

Reverie stores whatever the uploader produced: webm/opus from a browser's
MediaRecorder, m4a from a phone, wav from a desk recorder, occasionally mp4
with a video track nobody wants. "Export as MP3" has exactly one honest
implementation, which is to decode that and encode MP3 — renaming the file
would produce something every player rejects and some players play as noise,
under a name that promises otherwise.

<h2>Why the conversion lives in this service</h2>

ffmpeg is already installed here, for speaker embedding, and it is the only
thing in the stack that reads every container Reverie accepts. Spring has neither,
and giving it either would mean a second codec dependency in a second image to
patch. More importantly the bytes must not go through Spring's heap: an hour of
audio is tens to hundreds of megabytes, and reading one into a request thread
would hand any logged-in account a way to exhaust the API by clicking Export.

Here the file goes storage → disk → ffmpeg → disk → storage. It is never held
in memory in full, by boto3 (which streams and chunks both directions) or by
this module.

<h2>Why disk and not a pipe</h2>

`ecapa_embedder.decode_to_pcm` pipes audio through ffmpeg's stdin, and that is
right for it: it decodes short spans and never sees a container that needs
seeking. This cannot. An m4a or mp4 written by an iPhone puts its moov atom at
the end of the file, and ffmpeg reading such a file from a pipe fails outright
with "moov atom not found" — for the single most common non-browser upload
Reverie receives. A temporary file is seekable, so every format works.

<h2>State</h2>

There is no database. The derivative's key is derived from the source key, so
the object store is the record of what has been converted (see
`AudioDerivatives` on the Spring side). What is held here is only what an object
store cannot express: which conversions are running right now, and which one
just failed and why. Both are per-process, both are lost on restart, and losing
them costs at most one repeated conversion.
