"""Which suggester answers, and what it is allowed to look at.

Home and Add context are the same endpoint asked two different questions, and
the difference is the whole point of §14-16: with nothing selected the chips
should be about the archive, and with meetings selected they should be about
those meetings and nothing else.

Getting this backwards is what shipped. Home generated its chips from whichever
twelve meetings happened to be most recent, so a user with one product-marketing
call was offered it as the entry point to fifty unrelated meetings — and Add
context did not change the chips at all, so selecting three meetings left the
same generic row on screen, which reads as the picker not having worked.

The route is exercised rather than the pieces, because the routing *is* the
behaviour: every piece here already works in isolation.
