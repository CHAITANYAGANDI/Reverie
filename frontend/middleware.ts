/**
 * Nobody reaches the app without being somebody.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * The Clerk integration was complete on both sides — the backend validated
 * tokens against the JWKS, the browser attached them, and row-level security
 * scoped every read to the owner — and none of that stopped an unauthenticated
 * visitor loading `/home`. It stopped them *reading* anything: every API call
 * came back 401. So the app rendered in full, with an empty sidebar, an empty
 * list and errors behind each panel, which reads as a broken product rather
 * than as a locked door.
 *
 * The gate has to be in front of the page, not behind the data.
 *
 * ## Why middleware rather than a check in the layout
 *
 * A client-side redirect runs after the shell has mounted, so there is a frame
 * of the application on screen before it disappears. That frame is the thing
 * this is for. Middleware answers before anything is sent.
 *
 * ## Why it is conditional
 *
 * `clerkMiddleware` needs `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` and throws without it. Dev mode
 * exists so the whole stack runs with no keys at all, and a middleware that
 * crashed every request in that mode would make the dev story a lie. So the
 * mode is read here, and dev passes straight through.
 *
 * That is a switch with an authentication bypass on one side of it, so it fails
 * closed: anything other than the exact string `dev` — unset, misspelt, empty —
 * is treated as clerk. The same default is applied in lib/auth-store.ts and in
 * AuthenticationFilter, so no single missing variable can quietly open the
 * door.

 * <p>Written as what is *public* rather than as what is protected, so a route
 * added later is private until somebody says otherwise. The alternative gets
 * this backwards exactly once and nobody notices.
 *
 * <p>Exported for the tests, and only for them — nothing else imports it. This
 * list is the whole of the app's authentication boundary and the two mistakes
 * it can make are opposite and both silent: a page that should be public
 * bouncing off the login, or a page that should be private answering to
 * anybody. Neither is visible in a diff of a page component, so both are
 * asserted directly against the matcher. Next.js allows named exports from
 * `middleware.ts` alongside the default; `config` below is already one.
