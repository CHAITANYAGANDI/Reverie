/**
 * What actually goes on the wire for an export.
 *
 * <h2>Why this file exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>MP3 export was reported failing with "Meeting not found" on a meeting whose
 * summary and transcript exported perfectly. On the server that message is
 * written by one line — a lookup by meeting <em>and</em> owner coming back empty
 * — so the two candidates on this side were a different meeting id or a
 * different credential.
 *
 * <p>Neither was covered. Everywhere else in the suite `@/lib/api` is mocked,
 * which is right for testing components and useless for testing the request: a
 * mistyped path or an endpoint that quietly skipped the auth header would have
 * passed every test in the repository.
 *
 * <p>So this builds the real store, keeps the real `fetchBaseQuery`, and reads
 * the URL and headers off a stubbed `fetch`. The documents go through a plain
 * `fetch` in `lib/exports.ts` and the MP3 goes through RTK Query — two entirely
 * separate code paths to the same API — and the point of every assertion below
 * is that they agree.
