 * A request with no credential is a failure, not a request.
 *
 * <h2>What this replaces</h2>
 *
 * <p>`buildAuthHeaders` used to answer "I could not get a token" with `{}` and
 * let the call go out anonymously. Three things are wrong with that, in
 * increasing order of seriousness: the API answers 401 and the UI has to guess
 * what that meant; a retry sends a second uncredentialed request; and an
 * endpoint that tolerated anonymity would answer with an empty view of the
 * world, which is indistinguishable from an account that has nothing in it.
 * The last one is how a signed-out moment becomes "No conversations".
 *
 * <p>So the token is obtained first and the request is only made if it exists.
 * Nothing is sent otherwise, and what the caller gets is an ordinary
 * `FetchBaseQueryError` — which every screen in the app already knows how to
 * render, as an error with a retry rather than as an emptiness (see
 * lib/resource-state).
 *
 * <p><b>Not a wait and not a retry.</b> It resolves immediately with a
 * failure. Waiting for a token here would hang every hook on a page behind a
 * session that may never arrive, and retrying would be the loop this codebase
 * refuses elsewhere. Whether the app should be mounted at all is
 * `<AuthGate>`'s question, and it is answered from the same store.
 *
 * <p>`status` is `CUSTOM_ERROR` rather than 401: no server said 401, and
 * dressing a client-side condition up as a response the API never sent is how
 * error handling comes to be written against fiction. `isNotFoundError` is
 * false for it, so nothing reads it as a missing resource.

/**
 * Did the server actually say this does not exist?
 *
 * <h2>Why the distinction is worth a function</h2>
 *
 * <p>An RTK Query error is a union. A `FetchBaseQueryError` carries a numeric
 * HTTP `status` when the server answered, and one of `FETCH_ERROR`,
 * `PARSING_ERROR`, `TIMEOUT_ERROR` or `CUSTOM_ERROR` when it did not. Treating
 * the whole union as "missing" is how a page comes to tell somebody their
 * meeting does not exist because their wifi dropped, or because the token was
 * not attached yet and the answer was 401.
 *
 * <p>That is not a cosmetic difference. "Not found" is final and invites you to
 * give up and go back; a network blip or a 500 is temporary and wants a retry.
 * Saying the first when you mean the second is the app lying about somebody's
 * data being gone, and the response to it — closing the tab — is the one action
 * that does not recover.
 *
 * <p>Only 404. Not 403: a meeting somebody else owns is deliberately answered
 * as not-found by the API, so 403 arriving here would mean something else
 * entirely and should not be flattened into the same screen.
