 * What is left of the account's allowance, and what that permits.
 *
 * <p>100 transcribed minutes and 3 imports, for the life of the account. When
 * either runs out it is out: there is no reset date, no upgrade and nothing to
 * buy, so a refusal here is final rather than an invitation.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists in front of the server rather than only behind it.</b>
 * {@code UsageLimitService} is the authority and refuses at the moment a meeting
 * is created — which for a recording is the moment it is <em>saved</em>, after
 * somebody has already sat through the meeting. A server-only limit therefore
 * has exactly one way to enforce itself against a recording: destroy it. This
 * module is what stops the situation arising, by refusing to start a recording
 * that cannot fit and by stopping one that reaches the edge. The server stays
 * strict; it simply never has to be the one to say no.
 *
 * <p><b>Fail closed.</b> If the allowance cannot be read, recording is refused
 * rather than allowed. That is the opposite of the usual instinct and it is
 * deliberate: the alternative is starting an hour-long recording blind and
 * having the server refuse it at save time, which loses the meeting. A minute
 * of "we could not check your balance" is recoverable; an unsaveable recording
 * is not.

 * a limit on recording rather than on the product. Reprocessing is the
 * exception that proves it — that one really does re-transcribe the audio.
 *
 * <p><b>Silent while the balance is loading or unreadable.</b> Unlike recording
 * there is nothing irreversible to protect here — the server refuses on its own,
 * and greying a control out over a failed request would close a working
 * feature. That makes the server check load-bearing rather than a backstop, and
