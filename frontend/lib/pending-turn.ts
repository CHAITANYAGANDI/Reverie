/**
 * The question you just asked, on screen before the server has heard of it —
 * and still there when you come back.
 *
 * ## What was wrong, originally
 *
 * Send emptied the composer, and then the rail showed this:
 *
 *     Searching the transcript…
 *
 * and nothing else. The question was gone from the box and had not arrived
 * anywhere: for the five to ten seconds an answer takes, the only evidence that
 * anything had been asked was a spinner. Then the mutation resolved, the
 * `Chat` tag was invalidated, the history refetched, and the question appeared
 * — above an answer, as though it had always been there.
 *
 * The cause is that the question was only ever *server* state. Nothing in the
 * client held it between `submit()` clearing the input and the refetch bringing
 * it back, so there was nothing to render. Both chats had the bug for the same
 * reason, in two separate copies.
 *
 * ## What was wrong after that
 *
 * The fix held the turn in `useState`, which meant it died with the component.
 * Answers can take a while — a grounded question over a long meeting is a
 * retrieval, a rerank and a generation — and the natural thing to do while
 * waiting is go and look at something else. Doing that unmounted the chat, so
 * the pending turn vanished; coming back showed an empty thread with no sign
 * that anything had been asked. Worse, on a *new* thread the conversation id
 * was only adopted once the answer landed, so leaving before it did meant the
 * surface came back to a clean sheet and the answer was findable only by
 * hunting through the conversation picker.
 *
 * Nothing was lost on the server. The request is not aborted by unmounting, and
 * the exchange is persisted whatever the browser does. It was the interface
 * that forgot.
 *
 * ## So the turn lives in a module store, keyed by scope
 *
 * The same shape as lib/active-chat, and for the same reasons: it outlives a
 * render, it dies on reload, and two surfaces that should not share one cannot
 * accidentally. A scope is `workspace:home`, `workspace:ask`, or `meeting:<id>`.
 *
 * Callers that pass no scope get a per-instance one and the old behaviour
 * exactly — the entry is dropped on unmount. That is what the tests use, and
 * what anything genuinely throwaway should use.
 *
 * ## The rule that prevents a duplicate
 *
 * The turn is cleared when a user message the server did not have at send time
 * appears in the history. Ids are snapshotted on send rather than matching on
 * text, so asking the same question twice still reconciles: the second copy is
 * a different id and is not in that snapshot.
 *
 * It is resolved **during render**, not in an effect. An effect runs after
 * paint, so there would be exactly one frame in which both the persisted
 * message and the pending one were on screen — a flicker in normal use, and a
 * real duplicate to any test that looks straight after the response resolves.
