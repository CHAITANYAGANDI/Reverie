/**
 * The workspace chat's wiring, in one place.
 *
 * Two surfaces ask across the whole workspace — the pane Home opens beside its
 * list and the `/ask` route — and they share everything except which thread
 * each one is currently on. Both also need the same recovery when a thread is
 * deleted underneath them.
 *
 * Both surfaces are rendered by `components/chat/workspace-ask`, which is the
 * one place this hook is called from.
 *
 * Hooks cannot be chosen conditionally, so the alternative to this is each
 * surface repeating nine `use…Mutation` calls and two effects, which is nine
 * chances for them to drift.
 *
 * ## Why they no longer share the open thread
 *
 * They did, and it was deliberate: the home rail's expand button used to
 * *navigate* to /ask, so the two had to be one conversation or expanding a
 * panel would have abandoned a half-typed question. The pane maximises in
 * place now — see `toggleSidePaneExpanded` in components/side-pane — so nothing
 * depends on it any more, and what was left was two screens showing each
 * other's questions for no reason anybody could see.
 *
 * So the thread is keyed per surface. What is still shared is the *archive*:
 * one conversation list, one set of endpoints. A thread started
 * in Home's pane is still in `/ask`'s history picker and can be opened there
 * deliberately — it just is not adopted by accident.
 *
 * ## And why the thread does not outlive a navigation
 *
 * Opening Ask offers a new chat. It briefly did outlive one, on the reasoning
 * that Home should keep what you were asking while you went to look at a
 * meeting — which turned out to be the wrong default in use: the thing people
 * do is ask about what is in front of them, so arriving somewhere new and
 * opening Ask to a half-finished exchange from two pages ago is a panel that
 * has to be cleared before it can be used.
 *
 * That rule is **not implemented here**, and the first attempt was: this hook
 * passed `resetOnLeave`, which cleared the thread when the chat component
 * unmounted. It gave the right answer on these two surfaces by luck — their
 * panels unmount exactly when their routes do — and the wrong one on a
 * meeting, whose panel is a tab. It now lives at the route boundary, in
 * lib/chat-route.ts, and applies to all three surfaces the same way.
 *
 * Forgotten, not deleted. Every conversation is still in the archive and one
 * click away in the history picker; what is dropped is only which of them this
 * surface was looking at.
