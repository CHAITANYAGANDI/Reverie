/**
 * What a meeting that is still being made can honestly say about itself.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A stage is only marked complete when Reverie has actually reported that
 * result. Nothing here is derived from where a percentage happens to have got
 * to: the bar is an *estimate* that eases forward on a timer (see lib/progress),
 * and reading stage completion off it would tick "Transcript ✓" on a meeting
 * that was still being transcribed.
 *
 * Two real sources, and only two:
 *
 * 1. **The status the worker reported**, which arrives over the socket and the
 *    poll. `SUMMARIZING` is the worker saying transcription finished; the
 *    status did not move by itself.
 * 2. **The resource actually being there** — segments, a summary. Strongest
 *    evidence of all, and it overrides everything — *for the run that made
 *    it*. See the reprocess note below, which is where that qualifier was
 *    missing and cost four wrong ticks.
 *
 * ## The one number that is not an estimate
 *
 * `PROGRESS_TRANSCRIBED` is a *reported* value, not an eased one. The pipeline
 * emits it explicitly — `emit("TRANSCRIBING", PROGRESS_TRANSCRIBED, "Transcript
 * ready; preparing summary...")` — after transcription and speaker refinement
 * have both finished but before the status moves to SUMMARIZING. It is the only
 * thing that distinguishes the start of the transcribe stage from its end, and
 * it is the other half of a contract with ai-service/app/pipeline.py, exactly
 * like `statusProgress` in lib/format.
 *
 * The estimate is clamped to its stage band and can sit anywhere below the
 * ceiling, so `progress >= PROGRESS_TRANSCRIBED` is only trusted when the
 * *reported* progress said so. Callers pass `reported`, not the eased number.
 *
 * ## Why Transcript and Speakers finish together
 *
 * They are not two reported stages. The pipeline runs speaker refinement
 * *between* the opening `TRANSCRIBING` event and the `PROGRESS_TRANSCRIBED`
 * one, and emits nothing in between — so from outside there is no moment at
 * which transcription is known to be done and speaker matching is known not to
 * be. Both therefore complete at the same marker.
 *
 * Showing "✓ Transcript ● Speakers" would mean inventing a boundary the backend
 * does not report, which is the one thing this module exists to refuse. Speakers
 * is still listed, because it is real work that really happens and it is most of
 * the wait on a long meeting — it just cannot be ticked early.

/**
 * Whether the artifacts on screen belong to a run that has already finished.
 *
 * <h2>The bug this closes</h2>
 *
 * <p>Pressing Reprocess re-runs the pipeline from the audio, and it
 * deliberately leaves the previous run's transcript and summary exactly where
 * they were: a new run that fails must not have destroyed a good transcript on
 * its way in. `MeetingService.reprocess` does one thing about that — it flags
 * translations stale — and states the principle plainly: from that moment
 * nobody should read what is on the page as current.
 *
 * <p>The stage strip was reading it as current. `hasTranscript` and
 * `hasSummary` were true because the *old* results were still fetchable, so a
 * reprocess at 11% showed "✓ Uploaded ✓ Transcript ✓ Speakers ✓ Summary" over
 * a bar that had barely moved, and the caption read "Preparing transcript…"
 * while the audio was still being transcribed. Four stages complete on a run
 * that had produced none of them.
 *
 * <p>So the rule at the top of this file keeps its two sources and gains a
 * qualifier: a resource being there is evidence about the run that produced
 * it. While a later run is in flight, only what the worker has reported about
 * *that* run counts — the status and the one reported marker.
 *
 * <h2>Why the run number and not a guess</h2>
 *
 * <p>"A summary exists but the status is TRANSCRIBING, so this must be a
 * reprocess" would work most of the time and would be a run boundary invented
 * on the client. It also misses the case where the previous run failed before
 * summarising, which leaves a transcript and no summary. `processingAttempt`
 * is the identity the server already keys every stale-callback check to (V57),
 * so it is the thing to ask.
 *
 * <p>Absent — an older response, or a caller that does not pass it — is
 * treated as "first run", which is exactly what this module assumed before.
