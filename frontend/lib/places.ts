/**
 * The three places, and which one a pathname is in.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a file and not a compare in the band</h2>
 *
 * <p>V2 has no navigation column. What replaces it is three words in a 48px
 * band, and the whole of "where am I" is carried by which of those three is
 * underlined — so the mapping from pathname to place is the navigation, not a
 * decoration on it. A `pathname === href` in the JSX gets that right for
 * exactly three URLs and wrong for every page underneath them.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nesting is the part that matters.</strong> A folder and a meeting
 * are inside Library; they are not Library. Underlining Library fully while
 * standing in a meeting claims you are on the Library page, and underlining
 * nothing at all is the failure the old rail did not have — an icon column
 * always showed *something* lit, and three words that all go quiet one level
 * down read as chrome that has stopped working. So a parent place gets a
 * dimmer rule: present, plainly not current. See components/v2/places.tsx.
 *
 * <p>Some paths are in no place, and that is a real answer rather than a gap.
 * /record, /settings and /upload are things you are doing, not
 * somewhere you are, and each of them is left from a control of its own.
