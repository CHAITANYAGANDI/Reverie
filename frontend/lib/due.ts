/**
 * How a deadline is written on screen.
 *
 * The server decides *whether* something is overdue — see `DueStatus`, which the
 * reminder email uses too. This file only decides how to say it, and the one
 * judgement it makes is which of the two deadlines to show.
 *
 * An action item carries both the words that were said ("Tuesday", "end of
 * day") and our reading of them as a date. The date is the more useful of the
 * two once we have it: "due Fri, 14 Aug" answers the question, "Tuesday" makes
 * you work out which Tuesday. So the resolved date wins where there is one, the
 * original phrasing shows verbatim where there is not, and the phrasing stays
 * available as a tooltip either way — because the promise somebody actually made
 * is a fact about the meeting and should not be paraphrased out of existence.
