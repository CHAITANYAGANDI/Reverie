/**
 * The whole first-authenticated-render sequence, in one place.
 *
 * <h2>Why an integration test and not more unit tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>Readiness, the cache reset and the query hooks were each correct on their
 * own and each had passing tests. What was wrong was the <em>order they ran
 * in</em>, and an order is not a property of any one of them — it emerges from
 * where they sit in the tree and which React commit each one's effect belongs
 * to. Nothing short of mounting the real arrangement can see it.
 *
 * <p>So this renders the production nesting: the real store, the real `api`
 * with the real `fetchBaseQuery`, the real `AuthGate` and `SessionCacheGuard`,
 * and the components that failed in production — the real folder list, plus
 * hooks standing in for Home's meeting list and the usage badge that kept
 * working while the other two did not.
 *
 * <p>The folder list is the real one rather than a stand-in because it is the
 * component the screenshot was of, and because it has opinions of its own about
 * what an empty answer is: `undefined` is a skeleton, a failure is an error with
 * a retry, and only a settled empty list draws the blank section. A stand-in
 * doing `data ?? []` would assert the fix out of the test.
 *
 * <p>It used to be `FolderTree`, in the navigation rail. The rail is gone and
 * the tree with it; the list is `FolderList`, at the top of Library, and it
 * carries the same three-state rule — which is exactly why this test follows it
 * there rather than being retired with the component it was written against.
 *
 * <p>Only `fetch`, Clerk and the router are stubbed.
