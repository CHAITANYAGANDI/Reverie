/**
 * Marking a transcript: capturing a selection, and finding it again later.
 *
 * Two problems live here, and the second is the one that bites.
 *
 * CAPTURE. A browser selection is a pair of offsets into text nodes, which is
 * not something we can store — the transcript is rendered as one span per word
 * so that any word is clickable, so those offsets describe the DOM, not the
 * transcript. Instead the word spans carry the segment and character offsets
 * they came from, and a selection is read as "which word spans does it touch".
 * That also snaps every mark to whole words, which is what you want: a
 * highlight starting mid-word looks like a rendering bug, and a partial word is
 * a much worse anchor than a whole one.
 *
 * RECOVERY. Reverie lets people correct transcript lines. Fixing a typo near
 * the start of a sentence shifts every character offset after it — so an
 * annotation stored as offsets alone does not break loudly, it silently slides
 * onto different words. `resolveRange` therefore trusts the offsets only when
 * the text still standing there is the text that was selected, falls back to
 * searching for the quoted words, and returns null rather than guessing. A mark
 * that cannot be placed is reported as such instead of drawn somewhere wrong.

 * the offsets on the stored range. The two agree on an untouched line, which
 * is what made the first version of this look correct: it compared the
 * selection with `moment.ranges[].startOffset` and passed every test that did
 * not involve an edit.
 *
 * <p>Correct a line and they part. `resolveRange` repairs a mark by searching
 * for its quote, so the painted position follows the words while the stored
 * position stays where the words used to be. Measured on a running stack: a
 * highlight stored at `7..25`, forty characters inserted ahead of it, the
 * quote found again at `43`, the words at `43..61` painted — and a selection
 * of exactly those words compared against `7..25` overlaps nothing. The
 * highlight was visible and there was no way to remove it.
 *
 * <p>Taking the same `SegmentMark[]` the renderer paints from makes "painted"
 * and "removable" one condition instead of two that have to be kept in step.
 * It is the same overlap rule as {@link isMarked}, for the same reason.
