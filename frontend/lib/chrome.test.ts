/**
 * What the band carries, page by page.
 *
 * <h2>What this file used to assert, and why it does not any more</h2>
 *
 * <p>It pinned `headerChrome`: search absent on Account Settings, Import and
 * Record absent on the chat, on a meeting and on every settings URL, plus a
 * `bare` flag for the pages that ended up with an empty 64px bar. Those rules
 * are gone with the bar they refereed — see the header comment on lib/chrome.ts
 * and feature-parity §8. Deleting the assertions without replacing them would
 * have left the one rule that still matters untested, so the same URLs are
 * walked here against the opposite expectation: the band is the same shape
 * everywhere, and the tests say so route by route rather than in general.
 *
 * <p>The failure mode is unchanged and is why this is exhaustive rather than
 * representative: a control that is present on one URL of a page and absent on
 * another that renders the identical screen. Nobody reports that — it reads as
 * chrome flickering at random.
