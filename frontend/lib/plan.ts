/**
 * The one plan, and what is actually in it.
 *
 * Reverie has a single tier. That is not a limitation being apologised for —
 * it is why this page can be written honestly, because with nothing to sell
 * there is no reason to describe a feature generously or to leave an absence
 * out. Every line below is something the code does, at the limit the code
 * enforces.
 *
 * Kept as data rather than markup so the claims can be read in one place and
 * checked against the services that back them. Where a number appears it comes
 * from a named constant on the server — 200 folders from
 * `ProjectService.MAX_PROJECTS`, 2,000 marks from `MomentService.MAX_PER_MEETING`
 * — and the two a user can actually hit are `UsageLimitService.MINUTES_ALLOWANCE`
 * and `IMPORT_ALLOWANCE`.
