/**
 * Getting a finished recording onto the server, and watching what happens next.
 *
 * <p>Lives on the provider rather than in the control bar, because the thing
 * that reads it is not the bar: the meeting's own page draws the pipeline and
 * offers the one control that calls it off, and it is reached long after the
 * bar has gone.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here reports the upload any more.</b> There was a percentage,
 * drawn first in a docked bar and then in a modal that asked for the browser to
 * be kept open; both were removed on request. Against local storage the upload
 * is over in milliseconds, so what either of them actually produced was a flash
 * between pressing Save and the page changing. Save navigates straight away
 * now, and the wait somebody actually sits through is the pipeline — drawn in
 * the meeting's row on Home and as a banner on its own page. See
 * components/processing-row.tsx and components/processing-card.tsx.
 *
 * <p><b>Where it lands: Home.</b> It used to be `/meetings/<id>`, on the
 * reasoning that the wait belongs where the result will appear. The row on Home
 * says the same thing in a line, beside everything else there is to do
 * meanwhile, and does not make a screen out of waiting.
 *
 * <p><b>The phases past `creating` are still tracked</b>, and `processing` is
 * the one that earns its keep: it is what tells the meeting page that this is
 * the meeting being saved, and therefore the one whose pipeline can still be
 * stopped. `done` and `failed` now only put the phase back.
 *
 * <p><b>Announcing a finished meeting is no longer done here.</b> The toast and
 * the cache invalidation that stops Home listing a finished meeting as
 * "Transcribing" moved to `ProcessingDock`, which watches every processing
 * meeting rather than only the one this hook is holding — so a file somebody
 * imported got neither, and a recording got them only for as long as the tab
 * stayed on this hook's phase. What this hook still owes it is one call to
 * `trackProcessing` the moment the meeting exists.
