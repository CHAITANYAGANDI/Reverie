/**
 * Downloading a meeting.
 *
 * <p>The file is built by the server — see the export renderers — so this module
 * only has to ask for it and get it onto the disk. That is less trivial than it
 * sounds, for one reason: the request needs the session's auth header, and a
 * plain `<a href>` cannot carry one. So the bytes are fetched, turned into a
 * blob and handed to a synthetic link, which is also what lets the filename come
 * from `Content-Disposition` rather than from a guess made here.
 *
 * <h2>Why most of this file is about failure</h2>
 *
 * <p>Export was reported as intermittent: sometimes nothing arrived, and all the
 * screen said was "Couldn't export this meeting." Three separate faults were
 * producing that, and none of them were the network being flaky.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>The object URL was revoked in the same tick as the click.</b>
 *       {@link save} called `URL.revokeObjectURL` immediately after
 *       `link.click()`. A browser starts the download asynchronously; revoking
 *       the URL before it has read it aborts the download with no error
 *       anywhere. It worked most of the time, which is the worst amount.</li>
 *   <li><b>Several programmatic downloads in a row are refused.</b> Choosing a
 *       summary and a transcript fired two synthetic clicks, and browsers treat
 *       that as a site pushing files at you — Chrome prompts once per origin and
 *       silently drops everything after the first if the prompt is denied or
 *       dismissed. Hence {@link buildBundle}: more than one selected item is one
 *       archive and one download — the recording included.</li>
 *   <li><b>One failure cancelled the exports after it.</b> The parts were
 *       awaited in sequence inside a single `try`, so a summary that failed took
 *       the transcript and the audio down with it — neither attempted, and
 *       nothing said so. That is fixed in `lib/export-run.ts`, which fetches
 *       every selected part before it delivers any of them.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Everything except {@link save} and {@link openSignedDownload} is pure or
 * injectable, so the awkward parts — the query string, the header parsing, the
 * retry rule and the wording of a failure — are testable without a browser.
