/**
 * What finishing a meeting has to invalidate.
 *
 * <h2>The bug</h2>
 *
 * <p>When a meeting reached READY the badge flipped to Ready and Home stopped
 * saying "Processing" — and the page behind it still showed no summary, no
 * transcript and no action items until you refreshed or switched tabs and back.
 *
 * <p>It looked as though the backend had not finished. It had. The AI result
 * callback writes the transcript, the summary, the action items and the
 * insights in the same transaction that sets READY. The watcher invalidated
 * only `Meeting` and `Meetings` — the two tags the *status* lives in — so RTK
 * Query went on serving the empty results it had cached while the meeting was
 * still processing. Switching tabs "fixed" it because remounting refetches.
 *
 * <p>The tag list is asserted directly rather than through a rendered tree.
 * These are opaque strings that have to match `providesTags` in lib/api.ts
 * exactly, and getting one wrong fails silently in the direction of stale data
 * — which is the failure being fixed, so it needs to be caught by name.
