/**
 * One turn in a chat, with its actions.
 *
 * Shared by the meeting chat and the workspace chat. The bubbles were already
 * near-identical in both; the difference is only how citations are drawn — one
 * seeks the player, the other links to another meeting — so those come in as
 * children rather than being branched on here.
 *
 * Copy exists because the useful output of an AI chat is text somebody is about
 * to paste somewhere else, and selecting a bubble by dragging also picks up the
 * citation chips. Delete removes the whole exchange, not the single turn — see
 * `ChatService.deleteExchange` for why half of one is worse than none.
 *
 * ## Delete belongs to the question
 *
 * It used to be drawn under both halves, which put a bin under every answer —
 * and a bin under an answer reads as "delete this answer", which is not what it
 * does and not something the API can do. People pressed it expecting to clear a
 * bad reply and lost the question they had typed with it.
 *
 * On the question it is the same control saying the true thing: this is my
 * turn, remove it and what came back. The server pairs from either half, so
 * nothing about the request changed — only which bubble offers it.
 *
 * ## The two sides are not the same object
 *
 * They were, and it cost the answers. A question is short, belongs to the
 * person who typed it, and reads as an aside: right-aligned, in a tinted
 * bubble, capped at 85% so the alignment is visible. An answer is the thing
 * somebody came for — often a hundred words with a heading and a numbered
 * procedure in it — and putting that in the same container gives it a grey slab
 * the height of the rail, with the reading measure squeezed by a bubble that
 * exists to say "not yours".
 *
 * So an answer is set as a document: left-aligned, full width, no fill, and in
 * the reading serif — the same face as a transcript and a brief, because it is
 * the same act. The distinction the eye needs is already carried by the
 * alignment and the tint on the other side. Its text goes through `Markdown`;
 * the question stays plain, for the reasons in that file.
 *
 * ## The question is quiet, and that is a change
 *
 * <p>It used to be a filled pill in the primary colour. Under the V2 palette
 * `--primary` is INK — near-white — because an accent spent on every button is
 * an accent that means nothing, and a Save button is not an observation. Which
 * left this bubble a white slab beside the answer somebody actually came for,
 * with the loudest thing on the screen being the words they had just typed
 * themselves.
 *
 * <p>So the question is a raised surface with an edge: still plainly a bubble,
 * still right-aligned, still capped at 85% — and quieter than the answer, which
 * is the correct order.
 *
 * <h2>And it has to be visible while it is quiet</h2>
 *
 * <p>The edge was `--line`, which is white at 6% and documented as 1.14:1
 * against the canvas: over `--surface-raised` — a surface only two per cent
 * lighter than that canvas — the bubble had no perceptible boundary at all. A
 * right-aligned block of text with no shape around it does not read as
 * somebody's turn; it reads as a stray paragraph that has drifted right.
 *
 * <p>So it takes `--line-strong` instead, the same hairline the app uses for a
 * group boundary rather than a row divider, and a little more padding to go
 * with it. Still no fill beyond the raised surface and still no accent: the
 * question is not the thing anybody came for.
 *
 * <p>The corner nearest the composer is squared off — `rounded-br-md` against
 * `rounded-2xl` elsewhere. It is the one piece of shape in this thread that
 * says which side a turn belongs to, and it costs nothing: an answer has no
 * bubble to contradict it.
