/**
 * The bell.
 *
 * <p>A notification list fails in one direction: it says too much, somebody
 * stops looking, and then the upload that failed overnight sits unread among
 * forty that did not matter. So most of these tests are about the list keeping
 * its signal — the unread state has to survive a glance, dismissing something
 * must not navigate to it, and a failure has to be distinguishable from a
 * success without reading the sentence.
 *
 * <p>The other group is about the socket being an optimisation rather than a
 * dependency. Its frames carry a count and no content, so what a ping does is
 * trigger an authenticated re-read; a bell that rendered what arrived on a
 * public topic would be rendering whatever anybody put there.
