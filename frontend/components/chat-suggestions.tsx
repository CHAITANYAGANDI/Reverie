/**
 * Clickable starter prompts for a grounded chat.
 *
 * Shown only while the conversation is empty. A permanent row of suggestions
 * competes with the thread for attention and, worse, keeps offering "summarize
 * this meeting" to someone who already has the summary on screen.
 *
 * Rendered by the caller directly above the composer rather than in the middle
 * of the empty thread. The panel then reads bottom-up — input, then the
 * shortcuts into it — instead of putting a wall of chips where the
 * conversation is about to appear and pushing the first real answer down the
 * screen.
 *
 * A prompt ending in a space is an opening rather than a question — "Find every
 * discussion about " — so it is put in the input for the user to finish instead
 * of being sent. Sending it as-is would ask the model to search for nothing.
 *
 * <p>The chip used to append " …" to those, on top of labels that already ended
 * in one — so they rendered "Find every mention of… …". Both are gone. A chip
 * is a short phrase and nothing on it should look like text that ran out of
 * room; where an ellipsis is doing work it is in the label itself, once.

        NO HEADING. It said `Suggestions`, and the chips do not need naming:
        they are worded as questions, they sit directly above the box they fill
        in, and they only appear while the thread is empty. A label over three
        self-describing chips is a line of chrome in the one part of the panel
        that is supposed to be an invitation.

        <p>Still left-aligned and still directly above the composer. Centring
        them under a heading read as the page's main offer, which is wrong
        twice over: they are a shortcut past an empty input rather than the
        point of the panel, and centring puts the shortest chip furthest from
        the cursor that is about to be used.
