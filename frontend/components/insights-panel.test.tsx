 * Decisions and risks on the meeting page.

 * These rows are also handed to workspace chat as the authority on what was
 * agreed and when, so the editing path is not cosmetic — being able to correct
 * a row is what makes it safe to answer "does this conflict with what we
 * decided in March?" from the store.
 *
 * The split between the two kinds is the other thing worth pinning: a risk
 * rendered under Decisions is not a layout bug, it is a claim that the meeting
 * settled something it was actually worried about.
