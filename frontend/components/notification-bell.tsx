/**
 * The bell.
 *
 * <p>Everything Reverie does happens somewhere the user is not: an hour of
 * audio is transcribed while they are at lunch, a recap goes out overnight, a
 * link they shared is opened on Tuesday. Before this, the only feedback surface
 * was the live status socket on one meeting page — close the tab and the product
 * had nothing to say about the twenty minutes it spent working.
 *
 * <p><b>Two decisions worth writing down.</b>
 *
 * <p><i>Opening the panel does not mark everything read.</i> That is the common
 * shortcut and it destroys the only signal the list carries — somebody who
 * glances at the bell while waiting for a build would come back to find the
 * overdue task they meant to deal with indistinguishable from the nine things
 * they had already seen. Reading one marks that one; the rest is a button.
 *
 * <p><i>The socket only says "something changed".</i> The count and the words
 * come from the authenticated API. The STOMP topic is public, so a frame with a
 * meeting title in it would be a leak; see `NotificationPublisher` on the
 * server. The 90-second poll is what makes the socket an optimisation rather
 * than a dependency.
 *
 * <p><b>Inbox and Unread are two queries, not one list filtered twice.</b> The
 * panel holds twenty rows; somebody with sixty notifications and four unread
 * would otherwise open Unread and see whichever of the four happened to fall
 * inside the most recent twenty. `GET /notifications?unread=true` filters in the
 * database, so the tab means what it says however long the archive is.

 * quarter of a second from six inches of peripheral vision — which only works
 * if `Summary ready` carries the mark that is on the Summary panel. Three of
 * them did not.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Summary</b> was a `Sparkles`. A summary is written, not conjured,
 *       and a star beside it says "AI did something" rather than "your summary
 *       is ready" — the same star that has come off the meeting header, the
 *       chat history and the empty chat. It is `ScrollText`, which is what the
 *       Summary panel is labelled with in the meeting's mode row.</li>
 *   <li><b>Transcript</b> was a `FileText`, a generic page — and the generic
 *       page is also what `Summarize` uses on the selection menu, so the two
 *       most common rows in this panel were a document and a star. It is
 *       `Captions`, which is the Transcript panel's own mark and the one the
 *       export dialog puts on a transcript file.</li>
 *   <li><b>Processing started</b> was a `Loader2` — a spinner, drawn static.
 *       It is a broken arc at 16px, and a spinner in a list of things that
 *       have already happened is telling you to wait for the past.
 *       `Hourglass` says the same thing without asking anybody to wait.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The other four were already right and are left alone: `Mic` is the
 * Record control's own glyph, `AlertTriangle` is what the failure banner on
 * the meeting itself draws, `AtSign` is a mention in every interface there has
 * ever been, and `Eye` is somebody having looked.
 *
 * <p>Both retired kinds keep a glyph. Nothing emits `RECORDING_STARTED` or
 * `PROCESSING_STARTED` any more — see `NotificationKind` on the server — but
 * rows emitted before they were retired are still in people's inboxes, and a
 * `Record` of every kind is what stops a future kind from arriving with
 * nothing.
