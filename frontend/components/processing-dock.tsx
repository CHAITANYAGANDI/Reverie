/**
 * Following every meeting this tab is watching, and drawing nothing at all.
 *
 * <p><b>There is no docked bar any more.</b> There was one — a small card in
 * the bottom-right corner with a title, a percentage and a dismiss button, on
 * the reasoning that a background job should be visible from wherever you
 * happened to be. It was removed on request, and the request was right: a
 * meeting being processed is already stated in its own row on Home and in the
 * banner on its own page, so the card was a third copy of the same fact,
 * floating over whatever was actually being read. It also outlived its welcome
 * badly — a job that never reached a terminal status sat in the corner of every
 * page for the life of the tab, including over a *new* recording in progress.
 *
 * <p><b>What is left is the part nothing else does.</b> Completion — the "your
 * meeting is ready" toast, and the cache invalidation that stops Home listing a
 * finished meeting as still processing — has to be owned by something mounted
 * on every route, or it only happens when you are already looking at the
 * meeting. That used to be `useSaveJob`, which meant it fired for recordings
 * and never for imports. It is this, and it renders nothing.
 *
 * <p>So the component stays where it was in the shell and keeps its name in the
 * import list; what it does is subscribe, poll, settle and get out of the way.
 * Watching and drawing were always separate concerns here — see the history in
 * lib/processing-jobs — and this is that separation taken to its end.

/**
 * Everything the AI result callback writes, expressed as cache tags.
 *
 * <h2>The bug</h2>
 *
 * <p>This used to invalidate `Meeting` and `Meetings` and stop there. Those two
 * are what the *status* lives in, so the badge flipped to Ready and Home
 * stopped saying "Processing" -- and the page behind it still showed no
 * summary, no transcript and no action items until you refreshed or switched
 * tabs and back.
 *
 * <p>Which made it look like the backend had not finished. It had. The callback
 * writes the transcript, the summary, the action items and the insights in the
 * same transaction that sets READY; only this list had not kept up with it, so
 * RTK Query went on serving the empty results it had cached while the meeting
 * was still processing. Switching tabs "fixed" it because remounting refetches.
 *
 * <h2>Why a named list</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the next person to add something to that callback has to find
 * this. Inline in the dispatch it reads as plumbing; here it reads as the
 * answer to "what does finishing a meeting change?", which is the question
 * being asked.
 *
 * <p>Tag shapes are matched to the `providesTags` in lib/api.ts and are not
 * interchangeable -- `ActionItems` is a single `LIST` (the list is queried
 * across meetings and filtered by id, so there is no per-meeting tag to
 * invalidate) and `Usage` is `ME`, while the rest are keyed by meeting id.
 * Getting one wrong fails silently, in the direction of stale data.
