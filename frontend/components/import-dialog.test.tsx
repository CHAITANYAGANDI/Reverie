/**
 * The Import dialog.
 *
 * <p>Two things are being defended. The first is the absence of the upsell:
 * every product puts "3 of 3 imports left — upgrade for unlimited" under this
 * dropzone, Reverie has one free plan, and that line would advertise a product
 * that does not exist. It is the easiest thing in the world to add back by
 * copying a competitor's dialog.
 *
 * <p>The second is the language picker not lying. Reverie resolves the
 * transcription language when a meeting is enqueued, from the account — there
 * is no per-file language in the pipeline. A control here that read as "this
 * file's language" would silently do nothing to the file sitting above it, so
 * the copy has to say "future transcripts" and the test has to hold it there.

 * the copy had to spend two sentences saying so. A setting that cannot affect
 * what you are looking at belongs on the settings page, and Account Settings --
 * General still has it.
 *
 * **A speaker count**, offered as a hint and sent to AssemblyAI as a hard
 * constraint. Tell it two about a four-person call and two people are merged
 * into one; tell it four about a conversation and one person is split in half.
 * Its default was "work it out" and its own help text recommended leaving it
 * there, which is a control whose best answer is "do not touch me".
 *
 * Asserted rather than simply deleted, because both are the kind of thing that
 * comes back: the request must stay minimal, and the dialog must not start
 * writing to preferences again as a side effect of somebody importing a file.
