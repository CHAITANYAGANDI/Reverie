/**
 * The wait, on the meeting's own page — one banner, under the metadata.
 *
 * <p><b>It used to be the page.</b> This was a full-width Card with a two-line
 * header and a 2xl percentage, and because the tabs, the transcript, the summary
 * and the chat rail were all gated on `status === "READY"`, it was the *only*
 * thing rendered. A forty-minute recording therefore turned the app into a
 * progress screen for eight minutes, with nothing to read and nothing to do.
 *
 * <p>Now it is a slim band that sits beneath the title, duration and tags, and
 * the rest of the meeting renders around it in its normal layout with per-area
 * placeholders. Nothing about the finished page changed: when the meeting is
 * READY this does not render at all, and what is left is exactly what was there
 * before.
 *
 * <p><b>It is the only progress indicator on this route.</b> Nothing else in
 * the shell draws one — see components/processing-dock, which watches jobs and
 * renders nothing — so one job never draws two bars in one view.
 *
 * <p><b>Stop stays here.</b> This page carries the only control that ends a
 * pipeline, and what it does is delete the meeting — the worker is mid-flight
 * and cannot be recalled. It is offered only while this is the meeting being
 * saved, so it never appears beside a file imported an hour ago from a page
 * that never mentioned it.
