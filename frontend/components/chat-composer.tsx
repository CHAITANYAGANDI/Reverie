 * The box you type a question into, and the two decisions that go with it.
 *
 * **What to look at.** By default the chat reads everything you own, which is
 * usually right and is occasionally the problem: "what did we decide about
 * pricing" across two years of calls answers from whichever passages sit closest
 * in embedding space. Naming three meetings, or a folder, turns a vague question
 * into an answerable one. That is what "Add context" is — not an attachment
 * mechanism, a narrowing.
 *
 * **How hard to look.** Quick is the width the chat has always used. Thorough
 * retrieves more and asks the model to enumerate rather than summarise, which
 * costs proportionally more and is worth it for "list everything outstanding"
 * and wasted on "what did Priya say". The wording of both comes from the server
 * so it cannot drift from what they actually do.
 *
 * The textarea grows to a limit and submits on Enter, because a chat box that
 * needs a mouse to send is a chat box people stop using. Shift-Enter is the
 * newline, which is the convention everywhere this pattern appears.

        brand ring was drawn the instant the popover opened. Around a

        rectangle floating in the menu, which is exactly how it was reported.

        components/auth/auth-form -- an inset hairline, a barely-there fill, and
        `focus-within` moving the edge to brand. The ring the input carried is
        turned off because the field around it shows focus instead; the
        indicator moves, it does not go.

        <p>Inset by 8px rather than flush, so the field reads as a control
        inside the popover instead of a header band welded to its top edge. The
        rule underneath stays: it separates the search from the results, which
        is a different job.
