 * The toolbar over a turn.
 *
 * Two things are worth holding still here. The first is that everything on it
 * is a *toggle* — reacting and bookmarking both undo by repeating themselves,
 * and a toolbar that only ever adds turns a one-click gesture into a trip to
 * another panel. The second is that it must not swallow clicks while it is
 * invisible: it floats over the row carrying the speaker's name and timestamp,
 * so an invisible bar with pointer events is a timestamp that stops working
 * for no visible reason.
