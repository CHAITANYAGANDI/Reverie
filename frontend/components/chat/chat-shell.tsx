/**
 * The shape every Reverie chat has, with none of the data.
 *
 * Three surfaces ask questions — the rail beside the home list, the rail beside
 * a meeting, and the full-width AI Chat page — and until now each drew its own
 * version of the same thing. They had drifted: one centred its starter prompts
 * and one left-aligned them, and one wrapped the whole conversation in a `Card`
 * titled "Ask this meeting", so the panel was a box inside a box inside a rail.
 *
 * What is shared here is **presentation only**. The scopes stay apart on
 * purpose: workspace chat reads every meeting you own, meeting chat reads one,
 * and they are different endpoints with different conversation lists. Merging
 * them would be a data bug wearing a design fix. So these take rendered nodes
 * and callbacks, never a query.
 *
 * ## The layout, and why it is three fixed regions
 *
 *     ┌──────────────────────────┐
 *     │ header                   │  ← never scrolls: the thread picker
 *     ├──────────────────────────┤
 *     │ messages          ▲      │  ← the only thing that scrolls
 *     │                   │      │
 *     ├──────────────────────────┤
 *     │ suggestions              │  ← the dock
 *     │ composer                 │
 *     └──────────────────────────┘
 *
 * `min-h-0` on the middle region is what makes that work and is easy to lose:
 * a flex child defaults to `min-height: auto`, so a long conversation grows the
 * column instead of scrolling inside it, and the composer walks off the bottom
 * of the window. That was the old behaviour on the meeting page.

/**
 * Header, scrolling thread, docked composer.
 *
 * Takes the full height it is given and never more, so the page behind it does
 * not gain a scrollbar because somebody asked a lot of questions.
 *
 * <h2>NOTHING RENDERS THIS ANY MORE</h2>
 *
 * <p>All three surfaces use `components/chat/ask-panel` instead, which is these
 * same three regions plus the one thing this could not do: measure itself, so
 * the evidence sits beside the answer where there is room for it and under it
 * where there is not. `ChatDock` below is still shared by all three and is
 * unchanged.
 *
 * <p>Left here rather than deleted, deliberately. It is a presentational
 * component with its own passing tests and no data of its own, so it costs
 * nothing but the file — and the redesign it was replaced by is not yet
 * approved. Deleting it in the same change that replaces it would mean
 * reverting two things to reverse one.
 *
 * <p>It should go in the sweep once the panel is settled: this comment, the
 * component, and the `ChatRail` block of chat-shell.test.tsx, together. The
 * note in `ask-panel` explains what took its place and why.
