 * Narrowing a list of meetings to a stretch of time.

 * <p>A month grid and three presets, because the two questions people bring to
 * an archive are different shapes. "What have I got from the last week" is a
 * period and wants a preset; "what was that thing on the 13th" is a point and
 * wants a calendar. A control offering only one of them makes the other into
 * scrolling.
 *
 * <p>The window it produces is half-open — `from` inclusive, `to` exclusive —
 * so picking a day is midnight to midnight and a meeting recorded on the stroke
 * of one cannot appear under two different days. Both ends are absolute
 * instants computed here rather than a preset name sent to the server, because
 * only the browser knows which midnight the user meant: "today" in Auckland is
 * a different pair of instants from "today" in Lisbon.
 *
 * <p>Days in the future are not selectable and the month cannot be paged past
 * this one. Nothing was recorded tomorrow, so offering it is offering a
 * guaranteed empty result.
