/**
 * Rename, search and delete, for the folder currently open.
 *
 * <h2>Where this has been</h2>
 *
 * <p>On the page, then in the old per-page top bar, then in the shell's header
 * row once the band went global — and now in the folder's own masthead, which
 * is where it should have landed the first time.
 *
 * <p>The shell row is a full-width strip, so once the folder document became a
 * centred 680px measure these controls sat about 340px clear of it, hard right,
 * reading as chrome that belongs to the application rather than to the folder.
 * A control for one object belongs beside that object. The band stays global
 * and carries nothing from the page underneath; this is not in it and must not
 * go back into it.
 *
 * <p>It still reads the folder from the route rather than being handed one.
 * `useGetProjectQuery` is the call the page around it already made, so this is
 * a cache read, and the id is the one thing a caller always has.
 *
 * <p>Renders nothing until the folder resolves. A menu offering to delete
 * something unnamed is worse than a menu that arrives a moment late, and the
 * confirmation below is only meaningful once there is a name to put in it.
