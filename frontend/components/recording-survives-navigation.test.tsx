/**
 * START RECORDING → NAVIGATE → THE RECORDING STILL EXISTS.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is its own file, and why it uses the real provider</h2>
 *
 * <p>This is the regression the whole recording architecture exists to prevent,
 * and it is the one the V2 shell rewrite was most likely to reintroduce.
 *
 * <p>`useRecorder` tears down its streams when the component holding it
 * unmounts. While that hook lived on the record page, a client-side navigation
 * destroyed a live recording: clicking any link unmounted the page, stopped the
 * microphone, and dropped every chunk captured so far. **Nothing failed
 * loudly** — the recording simply ceased to exist, and the user found out when
 * they came back to a reset page.
 *
 * <p>The fix was to hoist the provider above the router, into the app-group
 * layout that stays mounted across every in-app route change. Which means the
 * property being defended is *structural*, not behavioural: the provider must
 * not be remounted. No amount of testing `useRecorder` in isolation can see
 * that, and neither can the shell's own test file, which mocks the provider out
 * to a passthrough.
 *
 * <p>So this file mocks nothing about the provider. It counts mounts of the
 * real `RecordingProvider` and drives a real route change through the real
 * `AppShell`.
