/**
 * The one menu that holds every operation on a processed meeting.
 *
 * <p>The things worth protecting are about what a click *costs*. "Copy link"
 * must never mint a public share URL — that publishes a meeting nobody asked to
 * publish, and it is one word away from the thing that does. And an operation
 * with nothing to act on must not be offered at all: a "Copy transcript" on a
 * meeting whose transcript was erased is a menu item that can only disappoint.
 *
 * <p>Several items were taken off this menu, and each is asserted absent rather
 * than simply deleted from the list above — a menu is exactly the place where a
 * removed item reappears, because adding one back is a single line and reads
 * like a fix.
 *
 * <p>Nothing else is ever absent. An item with nothing to act on is greyed and
 * stays where it was, so the menu is the same eight lines on every meeting;
 * `data-disabled` is Radix's mark for that, and it is asserted rather than
 * inferred from a click, because a disabled item takes no pointer events and a
 * click on one proves only that nothing happened.
 *
 * <p>Two items that used to be here are asserted absent by name. "Transcribe
 * again" re-ran the pipeline over the same audio and threw away every hand
 * correction and speaker rename to do it. And "Change language…" — a different
 * item, now a reused name — did the same thing while sounding like the
 * translation picker it sat next to. The name is back on the picker; what must
 * not come back is either of them re-transcribing.
