/**
 * What is left of the allowance, at the foot of the rail.
 *
 * <p>The shape is Otter's — the plan's name, a track beside it, and a bold
 * count under it — because it is the right shape: an allowance is only useful
 * where somebody sees it before they start something, not on a settings tab
 * they open once.
 *
 * <p><strong>The bar is minutes.</strong> It used to be the meeting count,
 * because that was the only number the server enforced; minutes were added up
 * and checked against nothing, so drawing them as a fraction would have
 * invented a ceiling. Both halves of that have changed. The allowance is now
 * 100 transcribed minutes and 3 imports for the life of the account
 * (`UsageLimitService`), the meeting count is capped by nothing at all, and the
 * bar is on the number that actually runs out.
 *
 * <p><strong>And there is no reset date.</strong> This said "None left until
 * 1 September" when the month was spent, which was the useful thing to say
 * about a monthly quota and would be a lie about this one. Nothing arrives on
 * the 1st. What it says instead is what is true: the allowance is the account's
 * whole allowance, and nothing already transcribed is taken away.
