/**
 * Everything you can do to a processed meeting, in one menu.
 *
 * <p>These were scattered: filing was a select under the title, re-transcribing
 * was a button in the masthead, erasure hid inside a menu called Export, and
 * fixing the speakers was a control you could only find by scrolling into the
 * transcript and hovering. That is not a set of choices, it is a set of places
 * to remember — and the two most consequential things on it (re-transcribe,
 * delete) were the two sitting loose in the header where they could be hit
 * while reaching for something else.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is hidden for want of something to act on. An item with no
 * transcript behind it is greyed, not removed: a menu that is five lines long
 * on one meeting and eight on the next is a menu you have to read from the top
 * every time, and "it is not there" and "it is not there yet" look identical
 * while you are hunting for it. Greyed says which of the two it is.
 *
 * <p>The two that *do* something — change language, regenerate —
 * also grey while one of them is still running. Two rewrites of one summary
 * raced in the same meeting is the concrete thing this prevents; the general
 * one is that none of the three is worth starting on a brief that is about to
 * be replaced. Copying is left alone, because copying what is on screen is
 * safe whatever is happening behind it.
 *
 * <p>Grouped by what an item acts on, and within that by what it costs to be
 * wrong. Filing and copying a link are free; then the transcript — copy it,
 * fix who said what, read it in another language; then the brief that was
 * written from it, which is the order those happen in, because changing the
 * language is the usual reason to regenerate.
 * Deleting the meeting is last and alone, so nothing lands there by momentum.
 *
 * <p>Deleting the recording and deleting the transcript used to sit above it,
 * as their own grains. They are gone from the menu; only the whole meeting can
 * be deleted here now. The endpoints behind them are untouched and the nightly
 * retention pass still calls them, so a meeting can still arrive on the page
 * with its audio already erased — which is why the page keeps the line saying
 * when that happened.
 *
 * <p>One operation opens a dialog and owns its own state here, because it is
 * self-contained given a meeting id: choosing a project. The rest are callbacks
 * — their data (the summary, the segments, the erasure timestamps, the language
 * being read in) lives on the page.
 *
 * <p>"Reprocess meeting" re-runs the whole pipeline over the same audio. It was
 * absent for a long time, under the name "Transcribe again", and the objection
 * to it was real: it bought the same pipeline over the same audio at the price
 * of every hand correction and every speaker rename anybody had made, one
 * confirm deep in a menu people open to copy a link.
 *
 * <p>One thing changed. The confirm now says what is lost instead of asking
 * "are you sure?": hand-typed corrections and speaker names are destroyed, and
 * the confirm says so in those words. It sits beside Delete rather than beside
 * the copy items, which is where its cost puts it.
 *
 * <p>"Change language" translates. It does not tell the transcriber it heard
 * the wrong language: that was a *different* item with the same name, it
 * re-transcribed from the audio, and having two controls saying "language" —
 * one of them destructive — is why this one was called "Read in another
 * language…" for a while. With the destructive one gone there is only one
 * thing here that says language, so it can have the shorter name. POST
 * /meetings/:id/language still exists and nothing calls it.
