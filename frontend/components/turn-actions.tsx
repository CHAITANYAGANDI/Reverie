 * The toolbar that appears over a turn when you point at it.
 *
 * The counterpart to {@link SelectionMenu}, and the split between them is the
 * unit each one acts on. Selecting words is how you act on a *passage* — this
 * sentence, half of that one — and everything on that menu needs to know which
 * words. Pointing at a turn is how you act on *what somebody said*, whole, and
 * none of these five need a selection: reacting, commenting, bookmarking,
 * copying and linking all take the turn as it stands. Making them selection
 * actions would mean dragging across a paragraph to do something that was never
 * about part of it.
 *
 * Hidden until hover, and that is not decoration. A transcript is for reading;
 * five icons rendered permanently beside every turn is a column of clutter
 * running down an hour of speech. Keyboard users get it through
 * `focus-within`, so it is reachable by tabbing without ever being reachable by
 * accident.
