/**
 * The third column, and how a page fills it.
 *
 * The AI chat used to be an `<aside>` inside whichever page drew it, which made
 * it a piece of that page's content: it began below the top bar, it ended where
 * the page's padding ended, and the header's buttons ran across the top of it
 * because the header spans the window and the rail did not. Home worked around
 * that with a margin on the header that restated the rail's own `clamp()` in a
 * second file, and the meeting page worked around it with a third copy of the
 * same numbers.
 *
 * It is now a pane of the shell, like the folder rail on the left: full height,
 * against the edge, with the middle column ending where it begins. Nothing has
 * to be cleared past it because nothing overlaps it.
 *
 * ## Why a portal, rather than the shell rendering the chat
 *
 * The shell knows the pathname and nothing else. The meeting rail needs the
 * meeting, its summary sections, its suggestions, the seek handler that drives
 * the player, and which tab is open; the home rail needs the workspace chat and
 * the action items. Hoisting any of that into the shell means either drilling a
 * page's whole world through it or fetching it twice.
 *
 * So the page keeps the component, its state and its queries exactly where they
 * are, and only the rendered output moves. Same trade as
 * components/header-slot.tsx, for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Why occupancy is a store and not `pathname === "/home"`
 *
 * Because it is not true of a path. A meeting has a rail once it is READY and
 * none while it is processing, and the pane must take no width at all in the
 * second case — a 28rem strip of empty card beside a progress bar is worse than
 * no pane. The page mounting a `SidePane` is the only thing that knows.

   *
