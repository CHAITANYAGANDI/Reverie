/**
 * One person's cached data must not outlive their sign-in — and the gate must
 * not open until it has been handed over.
 *
 * <h2>What is actually at risk</h2>
 *
 * <p>RTK Query keys a cache entry by endpoint and serialised argument —
 * `getMeetings({page: 0, size: 50})` — and not one endpoint in this app puts a
 * user or a session in that key. They never needed to: a bearer token decided
 * whose meetings came back. So if the store outlives a change of sign-in, user
 * B's first `getMeetings` is a cache <em>hit</em> on user A's.
 *
 * <p>The first half of this file measures whether the store does outlive it,
 * because if a hard navigation already destroyed the store there would be
 * nothing worth adding. The second half is the handover itself, and the third
 * is the part that makes it a barrier rather than a race: ownership is
 * published into the same state machine `AuthGate` reads, so the gate cannot
 * open before this component has run — whenever it happens to run.
