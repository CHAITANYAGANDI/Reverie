   * The clock, read on a frame and published on a budget.
   *
   * `timeupdate` fires roughly four times a second, which is fine for marking
   * which paragraph is playing but far too coarse to follow words: at normal
   * speaking pace several words pass between events, so the highlight jumps in
   * clumps. So the element is read every animation frame. What changed is what
   * happens next.
   *
   * ## Why it is not published every frame
   *
   * This value is passed down into the transcript, so every publish re-renders
   * several hundred segments. Doing that sixty times a second left React with
   * urgent work outstanding at all times, and an urgent update outranks a
   * transition — which is what an App Router navigation is. The symptom was
   * exact and reproducible: clicking Home while audio played did nothing at
   * all, and the moment you hit pause the app went straight to the page you
   * had asked for several minutes earlier. The navigation was never lost, it
   * was never allowed to finish rendering.
   *
   * Two things stop that, and both are needed. Publishing at most every
   * hundred milliseconds leaves the main thread idle in between, which is where
   * a route change gets rendered. And publishing inside `startTransition` puts
   * the clock in the same lane as the navigation rather than above it, so even
   * under load a playhead can never win against somebody trying to leave the
   * page.
   *
   * A hundred milliseconds is still two and a half times finer than
   * `timeupdate`, and shorter than the shortest spoken word, so the highlight
   * this loop exists for is unaffected.
