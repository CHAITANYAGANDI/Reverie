/**
 * The frame every page sits in.
 *
 * <h2>Two regions, where there were four</h2>
 *
 * <p>There was a 256px navigation rail on the left, a 64px header across the
 * top, the page, and a 448px pane on the right: 320px of permanent chrome on a
 * 1440px window, before the page got a pixel. The rail held two links, a folder
 * tree, a bell, an allowance meter and an account button, and the header held
 * global actions and the page's own actions in one row — which is why it needed
 * a rulebook to stop them colliding.
 *
 * <p>What is left is a 48px band and the page. Everything the rail carried
 * either moved into the band (the bell, the account, and the allowance inside
 * it) or became a destination in it — Library is where folders live now. The
 * band never changes shape from one page to the next, which is what lets it be
 * 48px and is why lib/chrome.ts is six lines instead of a hundred.
 *
 * <p>The side pane survived, because it is the one column that is genuinely
 * about the page beside it: the chat asking questions of the transcript it sits
 * next to. It is a pane of the shell rather than an `<aside>` inside the page so
 * that it runs the full height of the window and the page stops where it
 * begins.
 *
 * <h2>What this file is still responsible for</h2>
 *
 * <p>All of it survives the change of shape, and each is here rather than in a
 * page because it has to outlive a navigation:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the recorder, which keeps running when you leave /record</li>
 *   <li>the docked recording bar and the processing dock that report on it</li>
 *   <li>the clearance every page leaves for them</li>
 *   <li>⌘K, bound on the window so it works with focus anywhere</li>
 *   <li>the search overlay, which is opened from components three deep</li>
 *   <li>the import dialog, and the folder it files into</li>
 *   <li>the side pane's portal target and its open/expanded state</li>
 *   <li>navigation, in two shapes: the band and the bottom tabs</li>
 * </ul>
