/**
 * An assistant answer, rendered.
 *
 * Answers used to go through `<p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">`, which is a
 * reasonable default right up until the model has something structured to say.
 * A procedure came back as
 *
 *     ### General next steps
 *     1. **Find the official site**
 *        Search for the event page.
 *
 * and the reader saw the hashes and the asterisks. That is not a cosmetic
 * complaint: a numbered procedure displayed as one run-on paragraph is harder
 * to follow than the same information in prose, so the model writing *better*
 * made the answer read *worse*, and the obvious repair — telling it to stop
 * using markdown — would have thrown away the structure rather than showing it.
 *
 * ## Only assistant text comes through here
 *
 * A user's own question is rendered as plain text by `ChatMessageBubble`, and
 * must stay that way. Prompts are typed, pasted, and dragged in from
 * transcripts; running them through a formatter means somebody who quotes a
 * line beginning with `#` sees a heading, and somebody who pastes a table sees
 * their question rearranged. There is nothing to gain and a whole class of
 * confusion to lose.
 *
 * ## What is safe here, and why
 *
 * - **No raw HTML.** react-markdown does not parse it unless `rehype-raw` is
 *   added, which it is not; `skipHtml` is set as well so a literal `<script>`
 *   in a transcript quote is dropped rather than shown as text. There is no
 *   `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere in this file.
 * - **URLs are filtered.** The default `urlTransform` passes http, https,
 *   mailto and relative links and drops everything else, so `javascript:` in a
 *   link never reaches an anchor.
 * - **Links leave with `noopener noreferrer`**, and `nofollow` because the
 *   destination is model output rather than anything Reverie vouches for.
 * - **No images.** An answer has no business fetching a remote resource, and an
 *   image tag with a tracking URL in it is the cheapest way to find out that
 *   somebody read their meeting notes.
 *
 * ## Sized for the rail, not for a document
 *
 * This renders in a column about four hundred pixels wide. So `###` is styled
 * at roughly the size of bold body text rather than as a heading — the model is
 * told the same thing in `answering.system_prompt`, and the two agree — and
 * lists indent by just enough to show the hang. Code blocks scroll inside
 * themselves rather than widening the rail, which is the difference between an
 * answer containing a long line and an answer with a horizontal scrollbar under
 * the whole conversation.
