 * <p>Two items, and the shortness is the point: the plan, privacy and the
 * settings themselves are all tabs of one page now, so listing them here as
 * well would be listing the same page three times under three names.
 *
 * <h2>What moved, and why these tests open the menu</h2>
 *
 * <p>This used to be a 256px button at the foot of a navigation rail, with the
 * name and the second line printed on its face. The rail is gone; the trigger
 * is now the avatar alone at the end of a 48px band, and every fact that was on
 * the button is the first two lines of the menu it opens.
 *
 * <p>So the assertions below are the same assertions — never the user id, the
 * settings name beats the provider's, dev mode says it is dev — asked one click
 * later. That is deliberate: the facts are what these tests are for, and
 * checking them where they now live is the only way the move stays honest. The
 * one thing that is checked on the button itself is its accessible name, which
 * is the whole of what a picture-only control offers a screen reader.
