/**
 * ASK REVERIE — the strongest moment on the page.
 *
 * <h2>Why this one is demonstrated rather than described</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every competitor can show you a transcript. What is worth the largest
 * moment on this page is the thing that is hard: a question in ordinary
 * language, an answer, and — the part that matters — the exact words the answer
 * came from, playable. A sentence claiming "answers cite their sources" asks to
 * be believed. Watching a citation resolve into the line that was actually said
 * does not.
 *
 * <p>So the sequence runs once, when the reader arrives, in the order the
 * product runs it: the question is typed, the answer arrives, the citation
 * appears, and then the transcript underneath scrolls to the cited line and
 * lights the words. Four beats, and the fourth is the argument.
 *
 * <h2>What is real here</h2>
 *
 * <p>All of it, structurally. `useWorkspaceChat` and the meeting chat both take
 * a question, return an answer, and return citations carrying a `meetingId`
 * and a `start` second; `SourceList` renders them as a margin note; clicking one
 * opens the meeting at that moment. The scope chip is real — a meeting, a
 * folder, or the whole workspace. The question, the answer and the transcript
 * are invented, because a marketing page cannot use anybody's real meeting.
 *
 * <p>What is <b>not</b> here, deliberately: no similarity score, no "found by
 * meaning", no embedding language. Retrieval is lexical and
 * `POST /search/semantic` is unused.
