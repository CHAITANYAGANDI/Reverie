/**
 * Scroll choreography for the public page, and nowhere else.
 *
 * <h2>What motion is for here</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not decoration. A landing page is read in one pass, top to bottom, and the
 * only thing motion can honestly do is <em>pace</em> that pass — hold a moment
 * until the reader arrives at it, then let it settle. Large moments, one at a
 * time. That is the whole brief: functional motion, deliberate whitespace, and
 * demonstrations rather than assertions.
 *
 * <p>So there are two primitives and no more. Something arrives, or a group of
 * things arrive in sequence. Anything beyond that — parallax, looping
 * backgrounds, carousels — is the page performing for itself.
 *
 * <h2>Four rules every animation on this page obeys</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Reduced motion is absence, not slowness.</b> `useReducedMotion`
 *       returns true and the content is simply there. Not a faster fade — no
 *       fade. The product's own stylesheet already zeroes every duration under
 *       that query; this is the JavaScript half of the same policy.</li>
 *   <li><b>Once.</b> `viewport={{ once: true }}` everywhere. A section that
 *       re-animates every time it scrolls back into view turns a page into a
 *       slideshow and makes finding a sentence again a chore.</li>
 *   <li><b>Never a reason the text is missing.</b> The initial state is
 *       `opacity: 0`, which is rendered into the server HTML — so the page
 *       carries a `<noscript>` override that forces everything visible. A
 *       marketing page whose copy depends on JavaScript is a marketing page
 *       with no copy for anybody whose JavaScript failed.</li>
 *   <li><b>`m`, never `motion`.</b> Every animated element on this page is an
 *       `m` component drawing its features from `LandingMotion`. A `motion`
 *       component would pull the whole library — drag, layout projection and
 *       all — onto the one route where a stranger pays for it before they have
 *       decided anything. The provider runs `strict`, so this rule fails loudly
 *       in development rather than quietly in the bundle.</li>
 * </ol>

 * REDUCED MOTION CHANGES THE CLOCK, NOT THE TREE.
 *
 * <p>It used to return a plain tag instead of an `m` one. That reads correctly
 * and hydrates wrongly: the server cannot know the preference, so
 * `useReducedMotion()` is false there and the served HTML carries framer's
 * `initial` — `style="opacity:0"`. A client that prefers reduced motion then
 * renders the plain branch with no style at all, React reports
 * "Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match", and because the
 * error is outside a Suspense boundary the entire root switches to client
 * rendering. Measured on the public page with
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`: nine errors and a full re-render.
 *
 * <p>So the element and its `initial` are now unconditional, and `still` only
 * zeroes the duration and the delay. That keeps the promise this file makes —
 * "reduced motion is absence, not slowness" — because a zero-duration
 * transition is not a fast fade, it is no fade: the content is simply there on
 * the first frame after hydration. What it gives up is nothing, and what it
 * buys is that the server and the client render the same thing for every
 * reader.
