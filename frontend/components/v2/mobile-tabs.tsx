/**
 * The bottom tabs — navigation on a phone, and the fourth is Record.
 *
 * <h2>What this replaced</h2>
 *
 * <p>A hamburger that slid the whole 256px desktop rail in over a scrim. Three
 * problems with that, and the third is the one that mattered: it put navigation
 * behind a gesture, it reached the top-left corner of the screen — the furthest
 * point from a thumb — and it showed a folder tree, an allowance meter and an
 * account button to somebody who wanted to get to the chat.
 *
 * <p>Tabs are the platform convention on a phone because they are the only
 * arrangement where the destinations are visible without being opened and are
 * where the hand already is. The same three words as the band, in the same
 * order, so the app has one navigation with two shapes rather than two
 * navigations.
 *
 * <h2>Why Record is here and Search is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>Record is a fourth tab rather than a fifth control in the band because a
 * phone is the device most likely to be the recorder — it is the thing on the
 * table — and because a filled pill in a 48px band beside four icons is what a
 * thumb hits by accident. Search stays in the band: it opens a full-screen
 * sheet either way, so its position costs nothing, and a magnifier among three
 * destinations is the classic way to make a tab bar mean two things.
 *
 * <h2>It floats above the recording bar rather than under it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Both are fixed to the bottom. `--recording-bar` is published by the bar
 * itself and is zero when there is no recording, so this sits on the bottom
 * edge normally and lifts by exactly the bar's height while one is running —
 * measured rather than guessed, because that bar is not one height.
