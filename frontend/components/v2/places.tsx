/*
 * THE PLACES — three words, and that is the whole of navigation.
 *
 * Where you are is stated in a word rather than inferred from a lit icon in a
 * column, and the highlight is a 2px underline sitting on the band's own bottom
 * edge — a boundary the layout already has, so the active state costs no filled
 * rectangle and no extra chrome.
 *
 * A PARENT PLACE gets a dimmer underline: standing inside a folder or a
 * meeting, Library is not where you are but it is where you came from, and a
 * navigation that goes blank one level down makes people feel lost.
 *
 * Three, and the third is Ask Reverie. Record, Import and Search are
 * deliberately not here — they are verbs, and putting them in a row of
 * destinations is what makes a nav look symmetrical and behave wrongly.
 */

/*
 * The third slot is where the V2 design reference put Memory. Memory does not
 * exist — the migrations dropped the tables it was drawn from and nothing has
 * replaced them — so the slot carries the real third destination instead, at
 * its full name. "Ask Reverie" rather than "Ask" because the bare verb beside
 * two nouns reads as a control that got into the wrong row.
