/**
 * Navigation on a phone.
 *
 * <p>What this replaced was a hamburger that slid the entire desktop rail in
 * over a scrim — navigation behind a gesture, in the corner furthest from a
 * thumb, showing a folder tree and an allowance meter to somebody who wanted to
 * get to the chat.
 *
 * <p>Which makes the risk here specific: mobile navigation is the half of a
 * redesign nobody checks, and a phone that has lost its way to Library or its
 * way to Record has lost the product. So the same census as the band, plus the
 * one thing only this component has to get right — that it is the same
 * navigation as the band rather than a second one that can drift.
