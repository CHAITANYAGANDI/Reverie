/**
 * THE BAND — forty-eight pixels, and the whole of the permanent chrome.
 *
 * <h2>What it replaced</h2>
 *
 * <p>A 256px navigation rail down the left and a 64px header across the top:
 * 320px of chrome on a 1440px screen, 22% of it, present on every page whether
 * or not anything in it was wanted. The rail held two links, a folder tree, a
 * bell, an allowance meter and an account button — six things, of which the two
 * links were the navigation. The header held global actions and the page's own
 * actions in one row, which is why it needed a rulebook (lib/chrome.ts) to stop
 * them colliding.
 *
 * <p>This is one row, 48px, and it is the same row on every page. Left: the
 * mark and three words. Centre: Search. Right: Record, Import, notifications,
 * you.
 * Nothing here belongs to the page underneath — page actions live in the page,
 * beside the thing they act on — which is what makes a fixed shape possible and
 * what makes the rulebook unnecessary.
 *
 * <h2>Glass, once</h2>
 *
 * <p>The band is the functional layer above content, which is the only thing
 * translucency is for in this product. It is never nested inside another glass
 * surface and content never uses it. See `.v2-band` in app/globals.css.
 *
 * <h2>While recording, the band is the state</h2>
 *
 * <p>It turns rather than gaining a pill beside everything else. There was a
 * live-recording pill in the old header and it was removed for a reason that
 * still holds: the docked bar along the bottom carries the waveform, the clock
 * and the two buttons that end the recording, so a second statement of the same
 * fact was a smaller copy of a thing already on screen. What the band adds is
 * ambient rather than duplicated — you cannot look at any page without seeing
 * that the chrome has changed colour.
