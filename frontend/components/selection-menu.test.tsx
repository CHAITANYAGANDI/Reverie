/**
 * The menu over a transcript selection.
 *
 * Two of these tests are about a bug that is invisible in review and total in
 * practice: the menu is opened by a selection, and a selection is destroyed by
 * the next mousedown. If the menu does not suppress its own mousedown, every
 * item is dead — it closes the menu and clears the very selection the action
 * was about to read. Nothing throws; the buttons just do nothing.
 *
 * The rest is placement. A menu that renders below a selection near the bottom
 * of the window puts its last items off-screen, which on a long transcript is
 * most of the window's height.
