/**
 * "Your Profile" — the four things a person can say about themselves here.
 *
 * <p>A dialog rather than inline fields, and that is the point of it: the
 * settings page is read far more often than it is edited, and a page whose
 * every field is an input invites somebody to change one by accident while
 * scanning it. Editing is a thing you decide to start.
 *
 * <p>The password is not typed into this form. It is not Reverie's to hold —
 * there is no password column and no login form; the identity provider owns
 * sign-in — so the row shows dots and opens a dialog that hands the change to
 * the provider. Putting an editable box here instead would mean either storing
 * a credential this product has deliberately never stored, or a control that
 * silently did nothing.

 *
 * <p>Sending the current value back looks harmless and is not. `users.email` is
 * <em>null</em> for a Google account — Clerk's default session token carries no
 * email claim, so `provision` never had one to store — while the dialog shows
 * the address it read from Clerk. So "unchanged" on screen is a change to the
 * server, and `UserService.cleanAccountEmail` refuses it.
 *
 * <p>Which is how changing a photo produced "Your email address is managed by
 * your sign-in provider". The address rode along in a request that had nothing
 * to do with it, and took the whole save down with it.
 *
 * <p>The endpoint treats a missing field as "leave it alone", so the fix is to
 * send nothing rather than something. The address is now never sent by anybody
 * — it is a display on every screen that shows it — but the rule stands for the
 * name, which a Google account does not own either.
