/**
 * Account Settings.
 *
 * What matters here is the frame rather than the contents — each tab has its own
 * tests. Two things:
 *
 * The whole tab bar is always visible, whichever tab is open. Tabs that appeared
 * and disappeared depending on where you were would make "where do I change…" a
 * hunt again, which is the thing this page exists to end.
 *
 * And only the open tab is mounted. Plans reads usage; somebody changing their
 * name should not pay for it.
 *
 * There were six tabs, then two, and there are four. The four that went took
 * their features with them, and their URLs still have to resolve — a settings
 * link somebody bookmarked should show them settings rather than a blank pane,
 * which is what a catch-all route renders for a path it does not recognise.
 *
 * <p>Email and Data Retention are the two that came back: they were sections at
 * the foot of General, each with a query on them, so every visit to General
 * paid for both. The lazy-mount claim below is the whole reason the split is
 * worth anything.
