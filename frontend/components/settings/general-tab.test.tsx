/**
 * Account Settings → General.
 *
 * Three claims worth holding onto.
 *
 * <i>Two of these fields are descriptive and two are not.</i> Department and
 * Role are recorded and read by nothing. The name is matched against the owner
 * of every action item, and the language is sent with every transcription job —
 * so the test that matters is that saving one does not quietly clear another,
 * which is what a form that sends its whole state on every keystroke would do.
 *
 * <i>Email and password are shown and not editable.</i> Neither is Reverie's to
 * change; a development session has no sign-in provider and therefore no
 * password at all, and an Edit control over them would be a promise the product
 * cannot keep.
 *
 * <i>The footer says nothing rather than something useless.</i> The version
 * line and the jump link to this page's own retention section are gone, and the
 * legal line does not appear at all unless somebody has supplied real URLs —
 * Reverie ships no terms of service of its own.
