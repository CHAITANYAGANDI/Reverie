/**
 * General — who you are, what is done with it, and the way out.
 *
 * Five things, in the order somebody needs them: the identity block, the
 * language your meetings are held in, what Reverie does and does not do with a
 * recording, how long it keeps one, and the button that ends the account.
 *
 * Every field here is read by something. Your name is matched against the owner
 * of every action item, which is the only thing that turns a list of promises
 * into "my tasks". Language is sent with each transcription job: detection is
 * good and not perfect, and a wrong guess on a short or bilingual recording is a
 * transcript in a language nobody spoke. Department and Role used to sit here
 * too and were read by nothing at all — a form that asks for facts it never uses
 * is one people fill in for nothing, so they are gone.
 *
 * Email and password are the two Reverie may not own. The address is shown and
 * never editable, by any kind of account: it is the credential, so every route
 * to changing it is a route to losing an account, and it is fixed once the
 * account is made. The password is never Reverie's either — there is no password
 * column, so the change is handed to the provider, and a development session
 * has no provider and therefore nothing to rotate.
 *
 * The last two sections are the ones that delete things, and they are on this
 * page rather than behind a tab of their own because there is no longer a tab of
 * their own. Both endpoints have existed and worked for months with nothing in
 * the interface able to reach them: retention could only be set, and an account
 * only closed, by calling the API by hand. A deletion schedule that runs every
 * night and cannot be seen from inside the product is the worst version of this
 * feature, so it is now visible.

 * them, so nothing was going out and nobody could have turned anything on. It
 * also deleted the four messages, and it was right about those too — they
 * reported things the reader could see by opening the app.
 *
 * <p>Five messages came back that pass a different test: they reach somebody
 * who is <em>not</em> in Reverie, about something they cannot see from outside
 * it, while there is still something to do about it. Every one of them is off
 * until it is switched on here, which is the half V56 was missing.
 *
 * <h2>What is not on this list</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two messages have no switch and the page says so rather than hiding it:
 * running out of the allowance, and the account being closed. Neither is a
 * notification about the contents of an account. The second is the sharper
 * case — closing an account deletes the row these very switches live on, so by
 * the time it is sent there is nothing left to consult and no bell left to
 * ring.
