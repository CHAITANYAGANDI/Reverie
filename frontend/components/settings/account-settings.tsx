/**
 * Account Settings.
 *
 * One page, four tabs: General, Email, Data Retention, Plans. There used to be
 * several separate routes in three different places — Settings in the sidebar,
 * Billing in the sidebar, Privacy in the sidebar — which made every "where do I
 * change…" question a hunt.
 *
 * The tab is in the URL rather than in state, so a tab can be linked to, opened
 * in a new window and bookmarked.
 *
 * There is no Templates tab. A summary template is chosen per meeting — on the
 * upload page as a recording arrives, and from a meeting's own summary
 * afterwards — so a settings tab about them was a read-only catalogue sitting
 * one click from where the choice is never made.
 *
 * Each tab is its own component and fetches its own data. Nothing is loaded for
 * a tab that is not open: Plans reads usage, Data Retention reads the privacy
 * overview, and neither should be paid for by somebody changing their name.
 * That is the whole practical argument for the split — the two subjects that
 * came off General each had a query on them, and both ran on every visit to a
 * page most people open to edit one field.

        <p>Settings was the last page without it, after `/ask` — near-black from
        the band to the footer, which is how a page comes to look like a
        different application from the one it is inside. Home, Library, a
        folder, a meeting and Ask all draw it.

        <p>Pulled up by exactly the band height so the field is continuous
        through the glass and the band's hairline is the only line there. 30rem
        rather than Home's 34: what it has to lift here is the title and the tab
        row, not a masthead and a lede, and the wash should be gone before the
        first switch.
