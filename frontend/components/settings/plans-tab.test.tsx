/**
 * Account Settings → Plans.
 *
 * This tab used to sell two products that do not exist, so most of what is
 * asserted here is absence: no second card, no price, no checkout. Those are
 * easy to reintroduce — a pricing table is the most copy-pasted component on
 * the web — and each one is a promise made on behalf of work nobody has done.
 *
 * The other half is the difference between a limit and a counter. Five meetings
 * a month is enforced and gets a bar; minutes are added up after the fact and
 * checked against nothing, so a bar there would draw a ceiling out of thin air.
 * Both come from `/usage`, so a legacy account on an old unlimited plan must
 * not be told it has five.
