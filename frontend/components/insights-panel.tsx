/**
 * What the meeting settled, and what it flagged.
 *
 * These rows are read out of the summary the model already wrote — the same
 * words as the Decisions section further down the page — rather than extracted
 * a second time. That is what stops the two from disagreeing.
 *
 * They are editable because they are not only shown here. Workspace chat is
 * handed the decision record as the authority on what was agreed and when, so a
 * wrong row is a wrong answer to "does this conflict with what we decided in
 * March?", not a cosmetic blemish. Being able to correct one is what earns the
 * store that role.
 *
 * ## Why an empty card is not drawn
 *
 * Four of the eight templates carry a decisions section and three carry risks
 * or blockers; Interview, 1:1 and Memo deliberately carry neither. So on those
 * meetings there is nothing to read here, and there never will be — and the
 * page was drawing two cards anyway, one of them explaining that the template
 * does not track decisions. A card whose only content is an apology for
 * existing is worth less than the space it takes, and it took that space on
 * every such meeting.
 *
 * The nothing is not lost by hiding it. Where a template *does* track
 * decisions and the meeting settled none, the summary above says so in its own
 * Decisions section — that section is the source these rows are read from. A
 * second statement of the same absence underneath it is not more honest, only
 * longer.
 *
 * And no invitation in its place. A first pass at this left a pair of "Add a
 * decision" / "Add a risk" links where the cards had been, reasoning that a
 * decision the summary missed is worth recording by hand. That is not how these
 * get used. The rows are a *reading* of the summary, and somebody who thinks
 * the summary is wrong fixes the row that is wrong or rewrites with another
 * template — nobody types a decision into an empty page to keep a card
 * company. So on a meeting that settled nothing the panel is absent, and the
 * summary tab ends at the action items, which is where it ended before any of
 * this was extracted.
 */
/*
 * Audited alongside the transcript, the summary and the action items, and
 * deliberately left alone.
 *
 * <p>Those three each had a sentence to say when they had nothing -- "No
 * summary available.", "Transcript unavailable." -- and each was saying it on
 * the strength of `data` being undefined, which is equally what a failed
 * request looks like. This panel has no such sentence: with nothing to show it
 * renders nothing at all, for the reasons in the header above. So a failed
 * insights request produces an absent card rather than a false claim, and there
 * is no empty state here to make honest.
 *
 * <p>Which also means: <b>do not add one.</b> A "No decisions were recorded"
 * card derived from `(data ?? [])` would be this bug, freshly introduced, in
 * the one place on the page that did not have it.
