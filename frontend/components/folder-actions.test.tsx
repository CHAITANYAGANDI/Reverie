/**
 * Rename, search and delete, for the folder currently open.
 *
 * <p>These moved out of the folder page and into the top bar. The tests came
 * with them, because the one that matters is not about where the menu is: it is
 * the confirmation before a delete. A folder is one click to remove and the
 * recordings inside it are hours of audio, and the sentence promising those
 * survive is the only thing standing between somebody and believing otherwise.
 *
 * <p>The second group is about the folder not having loaded yet. The header
 * renders on every page, so this component mounts before its query resolves on
 * a hard refresh — and a menu offering to delete something it cannot name is
 * worse than a menu that arrives a moment late.
