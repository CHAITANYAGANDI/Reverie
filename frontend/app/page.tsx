/**
 * The front door.
 *
 * <h2>The composition, and where it comes from</h2>
 *
 * <p>`design-demo/final/55-landing.html`: the public canvas with its one
 * ambient wash, a 68px nav that does not out-weigh the hero, a centred claim,
 * and then the product itself at full width. What is added on top of that is
 * <b>pacing</b> — five large moments instead of one, each held until the reader
 * arrives at it, and each demonstrating something rather than asserting it.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately <b>not</b> added: cards, gradients, a logo wall,
 * testimonials, an integrations grid, a pricing table, a statistics strip. Half
 * of what makes a competitor's marketing page feel full is social proof and
 * integrations, and Reverie has one plan, no integrations and no named
 * customers — so those sections could only be filled by inventing them. This
 * page is longer because there is more true material, not because there are
 * more containers.
 *
 * <h2>The sequence</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Hero.</b> One claim, two ways in. Not animated: it is above the
 *       fold, and revealing it means the first thing anybody sees is an empty
 *       page.</li>
 *   <li><b>The product.</b> A still preview, immediately, so the page shows
 *       what it is before it explains itself.</li>
 *   <li><b>How it works.</b> One window moving through capture → understand →
 *       read, sticky, while the copy scrolls past it. Three stages of one
 *       recording, not three screenshots of three products.</li>
 *   <li><b>Ask Reverie.</b> The largest moment, and the only one that runs a
 *       sequence: a question typed, an answer arriving, and the citation
 *       resolving into the words it came from.</li>
 *   <li><b>Languages.</b> One line of a brief, in six of the eighteen.</li>
 *   <li><b>Included.</b> Two groups, hairlines, no cards.</li>
 *   <li><b>Yours.</b> The quiet close: no training, retention you set, export,
 *       deletion. Not a second call to action — the hero already asked, and a
 *       page that asks again at the bottom did not trust its own middle.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Every claim maps to production</h2>
 *
 * <p>No Memory, no Commitment Ledger, no Decision Drift, no Decision History,
 * no semantic search, no YouTube or PDF import, no integrations, no
 * system-audio or tab capture. `app/page.test.tsx` asserts the absence of each,
 * and the reasoning is in `docs/v2-implementation/final-parity-audit.md` §6.
 *
 * <p>This file is a server component. The clients are the four motion pieces
 * and `LandingMotion`, which is a context provider with no markup of its own —
 * so the copy is in the served HTML, with a `<noscript>` override below for the
 * one thing that would otherwise depend on JavaScript. `LandingMotion` wraps
 * the whole body rather than only the sections that animate today, so a reveal
 * added to the header or footer later cannot silently fail to run.
