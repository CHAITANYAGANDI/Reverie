/**
 * The record page.
 *
 * <p>There is no half before the recording any more, and most of this file is
 * about keeping it that way. Arriving opens the microphone: the route is only
 * ever reached by pressing Record, and a page answering that press with a
 * second button asking whether you meant it is a step that exists to be clicked
 * through. The two states left are the browser deciding, and the browser having
 * said no.
 *
 * <p>Several of these are negative, and deliberately so. There used to be a
 * second capture mode that recorded another browser tab, and most of what it
 * left behind was warnings: about Chrome, about sharing the wrong surface,
 * about having captured only one side of a conversation. With one source those
 * are not stale copy, they are copy that reports the product as broken.
 *
 * <p>The other thing held here is the sentence saying the transcript comes
 * after you stop. Reverie has no live transcription: the audio is captured in
 * the browser and only reaches the pipeline on Stop. A blank pane that looked
 * like it was waiting for words would promise captions the product does not
 * have, and the obvious conclusion to draw from it is that the microphone is
 * broken.
