/**
 * Record a live meeting from the browser.
 *
 * One source: the microphone. There was a second mode that also captured the
 * audio of another tab, for meetings happening inside the browser, and it is
 * gone — see lib/use-recorder.ts for why. What is left needs no choosing, which
 * is most of the reason the page in front of it got shorter.
 *
 * The result goes down the same presigned-upload → create-meeting path the
 * import dialog uses, so processing is identical from there on.
 *
 * Nothing is asked before the microphone opens, and nothing is waited for. The
 * two questions that used to be here — which of two capture modes, and whether
 * the room had been told — were removed, the first because it had one answer
 * left and the second on request. The button that replaced them has gone too:
 * this route is only ever arrived at by pressing Record, and answering that
 * press with a second button asking whether you meant it is a step that exists
 * to be clicked through. Arriving here opens the microphone.
 *
 * That the browser still asks its own permission question is the point at which
 * this is not silent — it is the browser's prompt, it names the site, and it is
 * the only consent gate Reverie relies on.
 *
 * The consent tick going means Reverie no longer *asks* about consent, and it
 * still claims nothing about it — the flag it used to set is not set by
 * anything here. What it does now is smaller and does not stand in the way: one
 * line at the foot of the page saying to make sure the room has been told, with
 * the sentence to read out one keystroke behind it. Nothing to tick, nothing to
 * dismiss, and no bearing on when the microphone opens. See
 * `RecordResponsibly`, and where the meeting is created in
 * components/recording-bar.tsx.
 *
 * The recorder itself lives in the shell too, so navigating away mid-meeting no
 * longer destroys the recording. This page is a view onto it: mount, unmount,
 * come back, and a running recording is still running.

 * <p>Not the consent gate that used to be here. That was a checkbox somebody
 * had to tick before Start, it was removed on request, and it is not coming
 * back: a tick box is a click to get past, and having got past it the product
 * then claimed the room had been told. Nothing here blocks, gates, focuses
 * itself, or has to be dismissed. The microphone opens on arrival exactly as it
 * did, and this renders under the result.
 *
 * <p>It also does not say that the browser's permission prompt is consent. It
 * is a decision by the person at the keyboard, and everybody else in the
 * conversation is unrepresented in it — which is the entire reason a sentence
 * has to be read out loud.
 *
 * <h2>Why the announcement is behind a disclosure</h2>
 *
 * <p>`RECORDING_ANNOUNCEMENT` is three sentences. Standing open, it is a
 * paragraph of somebody else's words on a page whose whole redesign was about
 * having no standing paragraphs — and it is only wanted once, at the start,
 * by somebody who has not thought of what to say. So the line is one sentence
 * and the words are one keystroke away.
 *
 * <p>The region is always rendered and toggled with `hidden`, rather than
 * mounted on open. `aria-controls` must point at something that exists, and
 * `hidden` is what keeps the collapsed text out of both the accessibility tree
 * and a find-in-page.
 *
 * <p>The sentence itself is imported, never retyped. It is tested in
 * lib/privacy.test.ts and it is the one string in this product that is meant to
 * be read aloud to other people; two copies of that is how one of them comes to
 * be wrong.

 * What this note is, while it is being taken.
 *
 * <p>Only once recording has started. Before that there is no note: a name
 * field over an empty page would be asking somebody to title a meeting that has
 * not happened, at the one moment nobody can answer.
 *
 * <p>The name is optional and empty rather than pre-filled. A placeholder can
 * be ignored; a value has to be deleted before anything can be typed, which is
 * how a date-stamped name nobody chose ends up defended by the delete key.
 * Left blank it falls back to the date on save — but somebody who knows this is
 * the Tuesday design review can say so while it is still true, instead of
 * hunting for the meeting afterwards to rename it.
 *
 * <p>The date is fixed at the moment recording began rather than read from the
 * clock, so the heading does not tick over while the meeting runs.
