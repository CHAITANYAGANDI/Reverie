/**
 * Now — the greeting, the list, and the two screens an empty list can be.
 *
 * <h2>What left this file, and what it left behind</h2>
 *
 * <p>There was a scope picker above the list with two options: <i>Recent
 * Conversations</i> (`unfiled=true` — everything outside your folders) and
 * <i>All Conversations</i>. It is gone, and so is the parameter: <i>All</i> is
 * a page now (**Library**), and <i>Recent</i> asks for the newest twenty
 * <em>wherever they are filed</em>. Roughly half the tests below used to drive
 * that control or explain what it hid.
 *
 * <p>Three groups went, and each is accounted for:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>"the wire says unfiled"</b> — <b>inverted</b>, not dropped. The
 *       assertion now is that this page never sends the parameter, which is the
 *       guard that makes every screen below unnecessary: with no filter, no
 *       filed meeting can be missing from Now.</li>
 *   <li><b>"a stored choice survives a visit and not a sign-in"</b> — re-asked
 *       of the date window. The production defect was a value stored under
 *       session 1 still being reported as ready under session 2, which is a
 *       property of `useStickyPreference` and not of the scope. The window goes
 *       through the identical machinery.</li>
 *   <li><b>"an empty Recent must say which filter emptied it"</b> — the three
 *       screens that answered this (everything-is-filed, the contradiction, the
 *       unresolved probe) are <b>unreachable</b>, because the filter they
 *       explained does not exist. The probe that fed them is gone with them.
 *       The rule underneath — <i>only a settled, successful, genuinely empty
 *       response may claim an empty account</i> — is untouched and has a whole
 *       describe block of its own below. That is the rule the production bug
 *       was about.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>What can no longer be asked here is what happens when All is chosen. That
 * is `app/(app)/library/page.test.tsx`.
