/**
 * Creating an account.
 *
 * <p>The strongest assertions here are about what the form does <em>not</em>
 * ask for. A sign-up is the moment somebody is deciding whether this is worth
 * the trouble, and every field is a reason to close the tab — so a field that
 * exists has to be one the product reads back.
 *
 * <p>The second group is about the screen after it. Clerk's sign-up completes
 * only once every required field is present, so a correct code can leave the
 * attempt short of an account — and this form used to report that as "check the
 * code and try again". Re-entering it then failed with "This verification has
 * already been verified", and so did Send another code, and the screen had no
 * way out of itself.
