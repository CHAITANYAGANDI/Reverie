/**
 * Creating an account.
 *
 * <h2>What it asks for, and what it refuses to</h2>
 *
 * <p>An address and a password. That is the whole form.
 *
 * <p><b>No username.</b> Reverie has nowhere to put one: there is no profile to
 * visit, no @mention, no sharing, and one account per workspace — so a username
 * would be a required field that nothing ever reads back, invented at the exact
 * moment somebody is deciding whether this product is worth the trouble. Where
 * the Clerk instance requires one anyway, it is derived from the address rather
 * than asked for; see `lib/clerk-signup.ts`. The same goes for a name here:
 * Google already knows it, and anyone signing up with an address is asked on
 * the first screen inside, where it is one field among the things that actually
 * configure their account.
 *
 * <p><b>No card, no company, no team size.</b> The allowance is fixed and the
 * account is free; asking anything to qualify a lead would be asking for
 * something Reverie does not use.
 *
 * <h2>The two roads</h2>
 *
 * <p>Google, which is a redirect and comes back at `/sso-callback`. Or an
 * address, which Clerk verifies with a six-digit code — that step is not
 * optional and not something this form can skip, so it is drawn properly rather
 * than as an interstitial.
 *
 * <h2>Verified is not the same as finished</h2>
 *
 * <p>The code proves the address; the sign-up completes only once Clerk has
 * every field it requires. This screen used to collapse the two and report the
 * gap as "check the code and try again", which sent people back to re-enter a
 * code that had already been accepted — and every attempt after the first, plus
 * Send another code, then failed with "This verification has already been
 * verified". There was no way out of the screen. So a verification that does
 * not complete the sign-up is now finished where it can be and named where it
 * cannot, and an already-verified answer is treated as the success it is.
