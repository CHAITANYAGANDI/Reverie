 * <h2>Two kinds of test here, and they guard against opposite mistakes</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Claim rot.</b> This page promised five meetings a month when the
 * allowance was 100 minutes; it advertised share links after sharing was
 * removed; and it offered "agent follow-ups" that would draft emails, create
 * tasks and write Notion notes — none of which ever existed, and one of which
 * cannot, because there is no email sender in this codebase at all. Marketing
 * copy rots differently from code: nothing fails when a feature leaves, so the
 * sentence outlives it. Those tripwires are unchanged below.
 *
 * <p><b>Design drift.</b> The second kind is new. This page had already been
 * rewritten once into an invented marketing layout — a transcript vignette, a
 * statistics strip, a numbered "how it works", an eight-item feature grid and a
 * closing slogan. Every line was true and none of it was the approved V2
 * composition. So the V2 identity is now pinned too: the kicker, both lines of
 * the headline, the two Included groups, the real brand mark, and the three
 * invented headlines named explicitly so they cannot come back.
