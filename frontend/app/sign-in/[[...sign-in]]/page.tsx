/**
 * Signing in.
 *
 * <h2>Reverie's form, Clerk's credential</h2>
 *
 * <p>This was Clerk's `<SignIn />` component. What that bought was every edge
 * of a sign-in handled for free; what it cost was the first screen anybody sees
 * being visibly somebody else's — their type, their spacing, their name at the
 * foot of it. So the form is ours and the credential is still theirs: nothing
 * here stores a password or decides whether one is right. `useSignIn` is a
 * headless hook — it renders nothing — and every failure below comes back from
 * Clerk and is put into Reverie's words by `authErrorMessage`.
 *
 * <h2>Three states, one screen</h2>
 *
 * <p>Sign in, ask for a reset code, and set a new password. They are the same
 * form with different fields, so they are one component: a person who has just
 * typed their address into the first should not have to type it again into the
 * second, and separate routes would lose it.
 *
 * <p>The catch-all segment stays. Clerk still routes some sub-steps under this
 * path, and a plain `/sign-in` would 404 on them.
